Preemption dynamics can also be analyzed through the \emph{survival rates} of VMs.
Let $S(t)$ denote the number of VMs that survive till time $t$.
Then, without loss of generality: $F(t) = A(1-S(t))$
% Well actually, not really. A spoils that, but whatevs.

In the case of the blended exponential distribution, $S(t)$ depends on $S(t)$ itself, as well as the failure rates of different phases and the current lifetime ($t$), as follows:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ramanujan}
  \dfrac{dS(t)}{dt} = \{\dfrac{1}{\tau_2} - \dfrac{1}{\bar{\tau}}(\dfrac{1}{1-e^{-b/\tau_2} \cdot e^{t/\bar{\tau}}}) \}S(t)
\end{equation}
