\begin{document}
This is an extended version of our conference paper ``Modeling The Temporally Constrained Preemptions of Transient Cloud VMs'' that appeared at ACM HPDC 2020. 

Compared to the preliminiary conference version, we have made significant new contributions to algorithms, system design and implementation, and experimental evaluation. 


%    New conceptual extensions
%    Experiments that provide new insights
%    New theoretical analysis and/or proofs supporting empirical results


\paragraph{New Technical Contributions:}

\begin{enumerate}

  
\item A new phenomological interpretation of the temporally constrained model using statistical mechanics (Tonks Gas Model). This gives insights about why the preemption rate is bathtub shaped. 

\item Additional reliability modeling, including the hazard function of our model. 

\item Cost-minimization techniques 

\item A new VM selection and reuse policy 

\item The use of a new \emph{bag of jobs} abstraction for scientific computing applications. We show how this abstraction can be used for system design and implementation.

\item Implementation and integration into a new system for scientific computing called SciSpot. 

\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{New Empirical Evaluation.}
This paper also adds empirical evaluation of the new techniques as well as extended evaluation of the entire system. In particular:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Impact of VM selection, and analysis of running times of different Scientific computing applications. 
\item Comparison with HPC waiting times (Figure ). 
\item Comparison of SciSpot cost with the state of the art in transient server selection (ExoSphere), in Figure 
\end{enumerate}


\paragraph{Detailed Changes.}
(Break this by section?)
\begin{enumerate}
\item Background and data analysis for bags of jobs in Section 2 
\item New subsection on reliability analysis of model (3.2.2)
\item Statistical mechanics lemma and analysis in Section 3.3
\item Application policies: Section 4.2 A new job scheduling and VM reuse policy is added, called ``Transition points''. Two new experimental results/graphs (Figure 5a and 5b). 
\item Cost-aware VM selection policy is added in 4.3. Expand. 
\item Checkpointing? Lets remove it
\item Implementation details added
\item 
\end{enumerate}
