This is an extended version of our conference paper ``Modelling'' that appeared at ACM HPDC 2020.

Significant changes in the paper:

The \textbf{new technical contributions are:}

\begin{enumerate}
\item A new phenomological interpretation of the temporally constrained model using statistical mechanics. This gives insights about why the preemption rate is bathtub shaped.

\item   Reliability modeling of the Hazard function, which enables ...

\item Minimizing the cost

\item A new VM scheduling policy using tipping points

\end{enumerate}

This paper also adds empirical evaluation of the new techniques as well as extended evaluation of the entire system. In particular:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Comparison with HPC (Figure )
\item Comparison with state of the art in transient server selection (ExoSphere), in Figure
\item 
\end{enumerate}
