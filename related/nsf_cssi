<h3>IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND REVISION NOTES</h3>

<div>
<p>NSF issued <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/postshutdown.jsp">guidance for its proposer and awardee community</a>
 regarding the initial resumption of operations following the recent 
lapse in appropriations and shutdown of the agency. That guidance noted 
that the Foundation was working to establish processes that would enable
 focus on a specific set of high-priority areas.</p>

<p>As part of this prioritization, for this particular CSSI program 
solicitation, NSF is providing the community with 60 days from the time 
of solicitation issuance to the proposal submission deadline date. While
 this timeline reflects a change from NSF's practice of providing a 
minimum of 90 days for submission of full proposals pursuant to a 
program solicitation, NSF notes that the revisions to the CSSI program 
solicitation are minimal, compared with the prior-year solicitation, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf18531">NSF 18-531</a>.</p>

<p>This solicitation continues the 2018 CSSI program by removing the distinction between <em>software and data elements</em>/framework implementations, and instead emphasizing integrated cyberinfrastructure services.</p>

<p>Revisions are noted below:</p>

<ul>
<li>The proposals do not have to include <em>software and data</em> as a prefix in their title.</li>
<li>The articulation and delivery of cyberinfrastructure services and 
capabilities are emphasized and included in the solicitation specific 
review criteria.</li>
<li>Quantitative metrics with targets for delivery and usage of 
cyberinfrastructure services and community creation are emphasized and 
included in the solicitation specific review criteria.</li>
<li>The section summarizing priorities for the collaborating NSF 
directorates and divisions has been updated for 2019. PIs have also been
 encouraged to contact program officer(s) from the list of Cognizant 
Program Officers in the division(s) that typically support the 
scientists and engineers who would make use of the proposed work, to 
gain insight into the priorities for the relevant areas of science and 
engineering to which their proposals may be responsive.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any proposal submitted in response to this solicitation should be submitted in accordance with the revised <em>NSF Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide</em> (PAPPG) (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf19001">NSF 19-1</a>).</p>

<h4>General Information</h4>

<p><strong>Program Title:</strong></p>

<div>
<blockquote>
<p>Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation (CSSI):<br>
Elements and Framework Implementations</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>

<div>
<blockquote>
<p>The Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation (CSSI) 
umbrella program seeks to enable funding opportunities that are flexible
 and responsive to the evolving and emerging needs in 
cyberinfrastructure. This program continues the CSSI program by removing
 the distinction between <em>software and data</em> elements/framework 
implementations, and instead emphasizing integrated cyberinfrastructure 
services, quantitative metrics with targets for delivery and usage of 
these services, and community creation.</p>

<p>The CSSI umbrella program anticipates four classes of awards:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Elements:</strong>
These awards target small groups that will create and deploy robust 
services for which there is a demonstrated need that will advance one or
 more significant areas of science and engineering.</li>
<li><strong>Framework Implementations</strong>: These awards target 
larger, interdisciplinary teams organized around the development and 
application of common services aimed at solving common research problems
 faced by NSF researchers in one or more areas of science and 
engineering, resulting in a sustainable community framework providing 
Cyberinfrastructure (CI) services to a diverse community or communities.</li>
<li><strong>Planning Grants for Community Cyberinfrastructure</strong>: 
Planning awards focus on the establishment of long-term 
cyberinfrastructure services, which would serve a research community of 
substantial size and disciplinary breadth.</li>
<li><strong>Community Cyberinfrastructure&nbsp;Implementations</strong>:
 These Community Software Cyberinfrastructure Implementations focus on 
the establishment of long-term hubs of excellence in cyberinfrastructure
 services, which will serve a research community of substantial size and
 disciplinary breadth.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>This particular CSSI solicitation requests only Elements and Framework Implementations classes of awards. &nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Prospective Principal Investigators (PIs) should be aware that this 
is a multi-directorate activity and that they are encouraged to submit 
proposals with broad, interdisciplinary interests. Further, not all 
divisions are participating at the same level and division-specific 
priorities differ. Thus, PIs interested in responding to this 
solicitation are encouraged to refer to core program descriptions, Dear 
Colleague Letters, and recently posted descriptions on directorate and 
divisional home pages to gain insight about the priorities for the 
relevant areas of science and engineering to which their proposals may 
be responsive. Prospective PIs should also refer to the 
directorate/division-specific descriptions contained in Section II of 
this solicitation.</p>

<p>Finally, it is strongly recommended that prospective PIs contact 
program officer(s) from the list of Cognizant Program Officers in the 
division(s) that typically support the scientists and engineers who 
would make use of the proposed work, to gain insight into the priorities
 for the relevant areas of science and engineering to which their 
proposals should be responsive. As part of contacting Cognizant Program 
Officers, prospective PIs are also encouraged to ascertain that the 
focus and budget of their proposed work are appropriate for this 
solicitation.</p>

<h3><a name="pgm_intr_txt" id="pgm_intr_txt"></a>I. INTRODUCTION</h3>

<div>
<p>The Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC) enables science and 
engineering research and education by developing, creating, and 
supporting secure, advanced, scalable, and global research 
cyberinfrastructure (CI). OAC investments emphasize cyberinfrastructure 
that is:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Science-driven</em></strong>: Promotes science and 
engineering excellence, enabling fundamentally new scientific and 
engineering advances; benefits science and engineering communities 
beyond initial targets;</li>
<li><strong><em>Innovative</em></strong>: Emphasizes unique NSF 
contributions; builds the capability, capacity, and cohesiveness of a 
national CI ecosystem; considers both human and technical aspects of the
 CI;</li>
<li><strong><em>Collaborative</em></strong>: Fosters partnerships and 
community development; actively engages CI experts, specialists, and 
scientists working in concert with domain scientists who are users of 
CI;</li>
<li><strong><em>Leveraged</em></strong>: Builds on existing, recognized capabilities;</li>
<li><strong><em>Strategic</em></strong>: Encourages measurement of progress and sharing of results; and</li>
<li><strong><em>Sustained</em></strong>: Provides benefits beyond the participants and the lifetime of the award.</li>
</ul>

<p>Over the past decade, OAC has supported a series of programs and 
activities that develop, deploy, and provision advanced 
cyberinfrastructure. The OAC portfolio has been distributed across five 
thematic areas: Data, High-Performance Computing, 
Networking/Cybersecurity, Software, and Learning and Workforce 
Development.</p>

<p>OAC Data and Software programs have been long-term investments, 
focused on catalyzing new thinking, paradigms, and practices in 
developing and using data and software CI services to understand 
natural, human, and engineered systems. Science and engineering 
challenges and use cases drive CI development, and successful CI systems
 strike a balance reflective of both the underlying technology and 
disciplinary research needs.</p>

<p>The CSSI program targets services that address all aspects of 
cyberinfrastructure, from embedded sensor systems and instruments, to 
desktops and high-end data and computing systems, to major instruments 
and facilities. The program will continue to nurture the 
interdisciplinary processes required to support the entire data and 
software lifecycle and will successfully integrate development, 
deployment, and support of CI services with innovation and research. 
Furthermore, the program will result in the development of sustainable 
CI communities that transcend scientific and geographical boundaries. 
The program envisions vibrant partnerships among academia, government 
laboratories and industry, including international entities, for the 
development and stewardship of sustainable CI services that can enhance 
productivity and accelerate innovation in science and engineering. 
Furthermore, integrated education activities will play a key role in 
developing and sustaining the cyberinfrastructure over time and in 
creating a workforce capable of fully realizing its potential to 
transform science and engineering.</p>
</div>

<h3><a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>

<div>
<p>The goal of the CSSI umbrella program is to create an ecosystem of 
cyberinfrastructure services that scales from individuals or small 
groups of researchers/innovators to large communities. The CSSI program 
anticipates four classes of awards:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Elements</strong>: These awards target small groups that 
will create and deploy robust services for which there is a demonstrated
 need, and that will advance one or more significant areas of science 
and engineering. It is expected that the created elements will be 
disseminated to the community as reusable services, with the potential 
for sustainability. The development approach may support the hardening 
of early prototypes and/or expanding functionality to increase end-user 
relevance.</li>
<li><strong>Framework Implementations</strong>: These awards target 
larger, interdisciplinary teams organized around the development and 
application of common services aimed at solving common research problems
 faced by NSF researchers in one or more areas of science and 
engineering, resulting in a sustainable community framework providing CI
 services to a diverse community or communities. Some awards are 
anticipated to be continuing grants, where funds will be released 
annually subject to agreed-upon milestones, based on approval by NSF and
 the availability of funds.</li>
<li><strong>Planning Grants for Community Cyberinfrastructure</strong>: 
Planning grants focus on the establishment of long-term 
cyberinfrastructure services, which would serve a research community of 
substantial size and disciplinary breadth.</li>
<li><strong>Community Cyberinfrastructure Implementations</strong>: 
These Community Cyberinfrastructure Implementations focus on the 
establishment of long-term hubs of excellence in cyberinfrastructure 
services and technologies, which will serve a research community of 
substantial size and disciplinary breadth. For example, the outcomes of a
 Community Software Cyberinfrastructure&nbsp;go beyond the software 
itself, including the development infrastructure and process, and the 
deployment and operation of sustained services successfully responding 
to science and engineering challenges, and enabling transformative new 
science and engineering. These Community Cyberinfrastructures will 
provide expertise, processes and architectures, resources and 
implementation mechanisms to transform computational science and 
engineering innovations and community software into robust and sustained
 services for enabling science and engineering, which in turn will 
transform research practices and productivity. Community 
Cyberinfrastructure&nbsp;proposals will bring together multidisciplinary
 teams of domain scientists and engineers, computer scientists, software
 and data engineers, and technologists and educators.</li>
</ul>

<p>For 2019, this solicitation welcomes proposals in two classes of awards:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Elements</strong>: up to $600,000 for up to 3 years; and</li>
<li><strong>Framework Implementations</strong>: $600,000-$5,000,000 for 3-5 years ($200,000 to $1,000,000 per year).</li>
</ul>

<p>Proposers are asked to identify whether their proposal is an 
"Elements" or "Frameworks" (for Framework Implementations) in the 
beginning of the proposal title (see Section V.A for details).</p>

<p>A competitive proposal will:</p>

<ul>
<li>Identify science and engineering challenges where the proposed 
cyberinfrastructure services enable fundamental new science and 
engineering&nbsp;advances, and describe how the proposed project fosters
 partnerships and community development that will have a significant 
impact on science and engineering research;</li>
<li>Indicate how the proposed cyberinfrastructure services build capability, capacity and cohesiveness of a national CI ecosystem;</li>
<li>Clearly articulate the delivery and outreach mechanism with quantifiable targets for metrics to measure impact;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Provide a compelling discussion of the cyberinfrastructures 
potential use by a wider audience and its contribution to a national 
cyberinfrastructure.</li>
</ul>

<p>NSF encourages participation by industry and international 
collaborators in all classes of awards where such participation clearly 
strengthens the proposed activity (e.g., involvement of specific and 
unique expertise or resources, or addressing sustainability).</p>

<p>International participants are encouraged to seek support from their 
funding organizations. NSF funds may not be used to support the expenses
 of international researchers at their home organizations. However, NSF

discovery in molecular science.</li>
<li>The <em>Division of Materials Research (DMR)</em> encourages 
proposals that focus on innovative software tools and data 
cyberinfrastructure that enable advances in the division's research 
areas and at the interfaces of materials research with other research 
domains. The division is particularly interested in projects that 
develop software tools and data CI to enable and support research that 
integrates digital data with experiment, computation, and theory, such 
as Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF; <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf16613">NSF 16-613</a>).
 DMR encourages proposals to further develop and to address gaps in the 
emerging community-wide "materials innovation data cyberinfrastructure 
network" to support discovery at all scales of research activities. This
 solicitation provides opportunities to include data developed through 
DMR-supported National Facilities and Instrumentation (NaFI), Materials 
Innovation Platforms (MIP), DMREF projects, Materials Research Science 
and Engineering Centers (MRSEC), and Partnerships in Research and 
Education in Materials (PREM). A priority is the development of data CI 
to support and stimulate the creation of innovative data-centric 
approaches in materials research which may require new paradigms.</li>
<li>The <em>Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS)</em> welcomes 
proposals that either (a) build computational and graphical tools that 
have broad application in mathematical sciences and related areas, or 
(b) translate significant and recently-developed mathematical and 
statistical models, algorithms, and methods into software tools that 
address substantial problems or data sets in fields outside the 
mathematical sciences.</li>
<li>The <em>Division of Physics (PHY)</em> will consider proposals that focus on innovative computational tools that enable advances in the division's research areas.</li>
</ul>

<p>MPS also supports education and community development in software and
 data cyberinfrastructure, for example, through proposals that include 
visitor support, postdoctoral opportunities, or short training courses 
that increase interactions of domain scientists and software and/or 
cyberinfrastructure specialists. MPS welcomes innovative educational 
activities to train next-generation creators of cyberinfrastructure, and
 to train the community at all levels on using cyberinfrastructure in 
ways that broaden participation.</p>

<p>The <strong>Directorate for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences (SBE)</strong>
 is interested in proposals that support the directorate's research 
priorities. SBE is particularly interested in using CSSI to support 
projects building on other infrastructure activities such as Resource 
Implementations for Data Intensive Research in the Social, Behavioral 
and Economic Sciences. SBE is also interested in projects that further 
the accessibility and use of SBE research results or SBE data, including
 data collected by NSF's National Center for Science and Engineering 
Statistics. SBE welcomes innovative approaches to big data problems in 
SBE-focused domains consistent with NSF's Harnessing the Data Revolution
 Big Idea. SBE encourages proposals that further the goals of SBE and at
 least one other participating NSF directorate.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Project Summary (1-page limit):</strong></p>

<p>The overview includes a summary description of the project, the 
innovative infrastructure being proposed, its research and education 
goals, and the community (communities) that will be impacted. The 
statement on intellectual merit should describe the potential of the 
proposed infrastructure to advance knowledge. The statement on broader 
impacts should describe the potential of the proposed activity to 
benefit society and contribute to the achievement of specific, desired 
societal outcomes.</p>

<p><strong>Project Description (15-page limit):</strong></p>

<p>The Project Description should define an agenda that will lead to 
sustainable software and data cyberinfrastructure services capable of 
enabling transformative, robust, and reliable science and engineering. 
In addition to the guidance specified in the PAPPG, the Project 
Description should explicitly address the following items:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><em>Science-driven</em></strong>: How will the project 
outcomes fill well-recognized science and engineering needs of the 
research community, and advance research capability within a significant
 area or areas of science and engineering? What are the broader impacts 
of the project, such as benefits to science and engineering communities 
beyond initial targets, underrepresented communities, and education and 
workforce development? The project outcomes should address 
well-recognized science outcomes.</li>
<li><strong><em>Innovation</em></strong>: What innovative and 
transformational capabilities will the project bring to its target 
communities, and how will the project integrate innovation and discovery
 into the project activities, such as through empirical research 
embedded as an integral component of the project activities? Such 
research might encompass reproducibility, provenance, effectiveness, 
usability, and adoption of the components, adaptability to new 
technologies and to changing requirements, and the development of 
lifecycle processes used in the project.</li>
<li><strong><em>Close collaborations among stakeholders</em></strong>: 
How will the project activities engage CI experts, specialists, and 
scientists and engineers working in concert with the relevant domain 
scientists and engineers who are users of CI?</li>
<li><strong><em>Building on existing, recognized capabilities</em></strong>:
 How will the project activities build on and leverage existing NSF and 
national cyberinfrastructure investments, as appropriate?</li>
<li><strong><em>Project plans, and system and process architecture</em></strong>:
 For an "Elements" proposal, the Project Description should include a 
high-quality management plan. The proposal should include user 
interactions and a community-driven approach, and provide a timeline 
including a proof-of-concept demonstration of the key components. 
Software or data cyberinfrastructure services should be sufficiently 
described and follow industry best practices, including the architecture
 of the CI and the engineering process to be used for the design, 
development, documentation, testing, validation, and release of the 
software, its deployment and associated outreach to the end user 
community, and an acceptance and evaluation plan that involves end 
users. The description of the CI architecture and processes should 
explain how security, trustworthiness, provenance, reproducibility, and 
usability will be addressed by the project and integrated into the 
proposed system and the engineering process, and how adaptability to new
 technologies and changing requirements will be addressed by the project
 and built into the proposed system, as appropriate.</li>
<li><strong><em>Deliverables</em></strong>: Does the proposed project 
clearly articulate the services and capabilities to be delivered, and 
how they are to be delivered? NSF encourages exploration of various 
delivery mechanisms, including but not limited to, those leveraging 
eXtreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE), 
leadership-class computing resources, OAC Software Institutes, Big Data 
Regional Innovation Hubs, individual organizational resources, and 
well-known public and private cloud services.</li>
<li><strong><em>Metrics</em></strong>: Does the proposed project clearly
 articulate quantifiable metrics for development and delivery of the 
services and capabilities to be delivered by the project, and for the 
anticipated community adoption and usage? Are quantitative metrics with 
targets identified for each year of the award? These should be simple 
but should also clearly show what the project will accomplish each year,
 the impact on science, and the breadth of the user community.</li>
<li><strong><em>Sustained and sustainable impacts</em></strong>: The 
Project Description should address how the project outcomes and its 
activities will have long-term impacts, and how these will be sustained 
beyond the lifetime of the award, as appropriate. Manuals and tutorials 
for using the developed CI should be delivered to the community. 
Software or data cyberinfrastructure services must identify the intended
 license to be used for the released CI, and the justification for the 
choice of this license. PIs who have been previously funded under 
previous CI awards should show quantifiable evidence of the use, impact 
and sustainability of the previously funded work (and include a citation
 to the published CI in their biographical sketches as one of their 
relevant products, if appropriate).</li>
</ul>

<h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES</h3>

<p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program
 for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All
 proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator 
serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other 
persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or 
both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the 
proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with 
oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names 
of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the 
proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These
 suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process 
at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, 
is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of
 interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain 
comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals.
 Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart
 that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated 
timeline) is included in PAPPG Exhibit III-1.</p>

<p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>

<p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf18045"><em>Building the Future: Investing in Discovery and Innovation - NSF Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 2018 – 2022</em></a>.
 These strategies are integrated in the program planning and 
implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's 
mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of 
research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, 
projects, and activities.</p>

<p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to 
foster integration of research and education through the programs, 
projects, and activities it supports at academic and research 
institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a 
diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and 
participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to 
the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research 
under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and 
engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, 
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing 
in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and
 learning.</p>

<p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding
 participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are 
underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health 
and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this 
principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, 
and activities it considers and supports.</p>

<h4><a name="reviewcrit"></a>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>

<p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and 
diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables 
breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and 
engineering research and education. To identify which projects to 
support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates 
consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and 
its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to 
promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, 
prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other 
purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, 
transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>

<p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>

<p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and 
organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by 
reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program 
staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding
 and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal 
agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic 
research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the 
potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
<li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to 
achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished 
through the research itself, through activities that are directly 
related to specific research projects, or through activities that are 
supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project 
activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative 
methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
<li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should 
be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation 
between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to 
implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation 
of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, 
assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a 
higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
</ul>

<p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader 
Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level,
 PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities 
described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should 
include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities 
that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs 
of those activities.</p>

<p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit 
review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the 
criteria can better understand their intent.</p>

<p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>

<p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National 
Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, 
however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight 
the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>

<p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong>
 during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is 
necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers 
must fully address both criteria. (PAPPG Chapter II.C.2.d(i). contains 
additional information for use by proposers in development of the 
Project Description section of the proposal). Reviewers are strongly 
encouraged to review the criteria, including PAPPG Chapter II.C.2.d(i), 
prior to the review of a proposal.</p>

<p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider 
what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to 
do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could 
accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the 
technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may 
make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to 
evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
<li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion 
encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the 
achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>

<ol>
<li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to
<ol type="a">
<li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
<li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
<li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, 
well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan 
incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
<li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
<li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home
 organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed 
activities?</li>
</ol>

<p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, 
through the activities that are directly related to specific research 
projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are 
complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific 
knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally 
relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full 
participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented 
minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); 
improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased
 public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and 
technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development 
of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased 
partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national 
security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and 
enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>

<p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review 
the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan,
 as appropriate.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>

<p>All proposals must clearly address the following 
solicitation-specific review criteria through well-identified proposal 
elements.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Science-driven:</strong> To what extent is the proposed 
project science-driven? How will the project outcomes fill 
well-recognized science and engineering needs of the research community,
 and advance research capability within a significant area or areas of 
science and engineering? What will be the broader impacts of the 
project, such as, its benefits to science and engineering communities 
beyond its initial targets, underrepresented communities, and education 
and workforce development?</li>
<li><strong>Innovation:</strong> To what extent is the proposed project 
innovative? What innovative and transformational capabilities will the 
project bring to its target communities? How will the project integrate 
innovation and discovery into the project activities, such as through 
empirical research embedded as an integral component of the project 
activities?</li>
<li><strong>Close collaborations among stakeholders:</strong> To what 
extent does the proposed project involve close collaborations among 
stakeholders? How will the project activities engage CI experts, 
specialists, and scientists and engineers working in concert with the 
relevant domain scientists and engineers who are users of CI?</li>
<li><strong>Building on existing, recognized capabilities:</strong> To 
what extent does the proposed project build on existing, recognized 
capabilities? Does the proposal adequately explain how the project 
activities build on and leverage existing NSF and national 
cyberinfrastructure investments, as appropriate?</li>
<li><strong>Project plans, and system and process architecture:</strong>
 How well-described are the project plans, and system and process 
architecture? Does the project include adequate user interactions and a 
community-driven approach, and provide a timeline including a 
proof-of-concept demonstration of the key components? If the outcome of 
the project is software or data cyberinfrastructure services, does the 
proposal adequately describe the architecture of the CI and the 
engineering process to be used for the design, development, 
documentation, testing, validation, and release of the software 
services, its deployment and associated outreach to the end user 
community, and an acceptance and evaluation plan that involves end 
users, and follow industry best practices? Does the project adequately 
explain how security, trustworthiness, provenance, reproducibility, and 
usability will be addressed by the project and integrated into the 
proposed system and the engineering process, and how adaptability to new
 technologies and changing requirements will be addressed by the project
 and built into the proposed system, as appropriate?</li>
<li><strong>Deliverables:</strong> Does the proposed project clearly articulate the services and capabilities to be delivered, and how they are to be delivered?</li>
<li><strong>Metrics:</strong> Does the proposed project clearly 
articulate quantifiable metrics for development and delivery of the 
services and capabilities to be delivered by the project, and for the 
anticipated community adoption and usage? Are quantitative metrics with 
targets identified for each year of the award?</li>
<li><strong>Sustained and sustainable impacts:</strong> How well does 
the project address the achievement of sustained and sustainable 
impacts? Does the project adequately address how the project outcomes 
and its activities will have long-term impacts, and how these will be 
sustained beyond the lifetime of the award, as appropriate?</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>

<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>

<p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National 
Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, 
additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying 
narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer 
and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's 
review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a 
recommendation.</p>

<p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration
 of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the 
cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or 
recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether
 their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within 
six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from 
new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time
 interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, 
whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts 
upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>

<p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals 
recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and 
Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. 
After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements 
Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other 
agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements 
Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or 
authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF 
should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF 
Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes 
financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or 
cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer 
does so at their own risk.</p>

<p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal 
Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases,
 reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of 
reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any 
reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal 
Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the 
proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline
 funding.</p>

<h3><a name="awardadmin" id="awardadmin"></a>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>

<h4><a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>A. Notification of the Award</h4>

<p>Notification of the award is made to <em>the submitting organization</em>
 by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. 
Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly 
as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. 
Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, 
will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See 
Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)</p>

<h4><a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>B. Award Conditions</h4>

<p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award notice, which includes any 
special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments 
thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of 
expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates 
any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) 
the proposal referenced in the award notice; (4) the applicable award 
conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1)*; or Research Terms 
and Conditions* and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may 
be incorporated by reference in the award notice. Cooperative agreements
 also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement 
Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the 
applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are 
electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and 
transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>

<p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:nsfpubs@nsf.gov">nsfpubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>

<p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other 
important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained 
in the NSF <em>Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide</em> (PAPPG) Chapter VII, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=pappg">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=pappg</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Special Award Conditions:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Awardees must participate in annual PI meetings with travel costs supported by the awards.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>C. Reporting Requirements</h4>

<p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing 
grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report
 to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end
 of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require 
submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days 
following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a 
final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general 
public.</p>

<p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or 
the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any
 future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all 
identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the 
formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of 
required data.</p>

<p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, 
available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual
 and final project reports. Such reports provide information on 
accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), 
publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. 
Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by 
the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The 
project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using 
Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared 
specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. 
This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted
 by the PI.</p>

<p>More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and 
other important information on the administration of NSF awards is

<h3><a name="othpgm" id="othpgm"></a>IX. OTHER INFORMATION</h3>

<p>The NSF website provides the most comprehensive source of information
 on NSF Directorates (including contact information), programs and 
funding opportunities. Use of this website by potential proposers is 
strongly encouraged. In addition, "NSF Update" is an 
information-delivery system designed to keep potential proposers and 
other interested parties apprised of new NSF funding opportunities and 
publications, important changes in proposal and award policies and 
procedures, and upcoming NSF <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/outreach.jsp">Grants Conferences</a>.
 Subscribers are informed through e-mail or the user's Web browser each 
time new publications are issued that match their identified interests. 
"NSF Update" also is available on <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/goodbye?https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USNSF/subscriber/new?topic_id=USNSF_179">NSF's website</a>.</p>

<p>Grants.gov provides an additional electronic capability to search for
 Federal government-wide grant opportunities. NSF funding opportunities 
may be accessed via this mechanism. Further information on Grants.gov 
may be obtained at <a href="http://www.grants.gov/">http://www.grants.gov</a>.</p>

<h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>

<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal 
agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as 
amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to 
promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, 
prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all 
fields of science and engineering."</p>

<p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and 
engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to 
more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses,
 informal science organizations and other research organizations 
throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of 
Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>

<p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, 
education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are 
funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand 
applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency 
operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research 
Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and 
Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative 
research between universities and industry, US participation in 
international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational 
activities at every academic level.</p>

<p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em>
 (FASED) provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable 
persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See the <em>NSF Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide</em> Chapter II.E.6 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>

<p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf 
(TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that 
enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the 
Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD 
may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 
877-8339.</p>

<h3>PRIVACY ACT AND PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENTS</h3>

<p>The information requested on proposal forms and project reports is 
solicited under the authority of the National Science Foundation Act of 
1950, as amended. The information on proposal forms will be used in 
connection with the selection of qualified proposals; and project 
reports submitted by awardees will be used for program evaluation and 
reporting within the Executive Branch and to Congress. The information 
requested may be disclosed to qualified reviewers and staff assistants 
as part of the proposal review process; to proposer 
institutions/grantees to provide or obtain data regarding the proposal 
review process, award decisions, or the administration of awards; to 
government contractors, experts, volunteers and researchers and 
educators as necessary to complete assigned work; to other government 
agencies or other entities needing information regarding applicants or 
nominees as part of a joint application review process, or in order to 
coordinate programs or policy; and to another Federal agency, court, or 
party in a court or Federal administrative proceeding if the government 
is a party. Information about Principal Investigators may be added to 
the Reviewer file and used to select potential candidates to serve as 
peer reviewers or advisory committee members. See Systems of Records, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-50_Principal_Investigator_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-50</a>, "Principal Investigator/Proposal File and Associated Records," 69 Federal Register 26410 (May 12, 2004), and <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/policies/SOR_PA_NSF-51_Reviewer_Proposal_File.pdf">NSF-51</a>,
 "Reviewer/Proposal File and Associated Records," 69 Federal Register 
26410 (May 12, 2004). Submission of the information is voluntary. 
Failure to provide full and complete information, however, may reduce 
the possibility of receiving an award.</p>

<p>An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to
 respond to, an information collection unless it displays a valid Office
 of Management and Budget (OMB) control number. The OMB control number 
for this collection is 3145-0058. Public reporting burden for this 
collection of information is estimated to average 120 hours per 
response, including the time for reviewing instructions. Send comments 
regarding the burden estimate and any other aspect of this collection of
 information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to:</p>
