<h4>General Information</h4>

<p><strong>Program Title:</strong></p>

<div>
<blockquote>
<p>Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p><strong>Synopsis of Program:</strong></p>

<div>
<blockquote>
<p>DMREF is the primary program by which NSF participates in the <a href="https://www.mgi.gov/sites/default/files/documents/materials_genome_initiative-final.pdf">Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) for Global Competitiveness</a>.
 MGI recognizes the importance of materials science and engineering to 
the well-being and advancement of society and aims to "deploy advanced 
materials at least twice as fast as possible today, at a fraction of the
 cost." MGI integrates materials discovery, development, property 
optimization, and systems design with a shared computational framework. 
This framework facilitates collaboration and coordination of research 
activities, analytical tools, experimental results, and critical 
evaluation in pursuit of the MGI goals. Consistent with the <a href="https://www.mgi.gov/sites/default/files/documents/mgi_strategic_plan_-_dec_2014.pdf">MGI Strategic Plan</a>, DMREF highlights four sets of goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>Leading a culture shift in materials science and engineering research to encourage and facilitate an integrated team approach;</li>
<li>Integrating experimentation, computation, and theory and equipping 
the materials science and engineering communities with advanced tools 
and techniques;</li>
<li>Making digital data accessible, findable, and useful to the community; and</li>
<li>Creating a world-class materials science and engineering workforce that is trained for careers in academia or industry.</li>
</ul>

<p>Accordingly, DMREF will support activities that significantly 
accelerate materials discovery and/or development by building the 
fundamental knowledge base needed to design and make materials and/or 
devices with specific and desired functions or properties. This will be 
accomplished through forming interdisciplinary teams of researchers 
working synergistically in a "closed loop" fashion, building a vibrant 
research community, leveraging data science, providing ready access to 
materials data, and educating the future MGI workforce. Specifically, 
achieving this goal will involve modeling, analysis, and computational 
simulations, validated and verified through sample preparation, 
characterization, and/or device demonstration.</p>

<p>Computational efforts will begin at the smallest appropriate length 
scale, such as electronic, atomic, molecular, nano-, micro-, and 
meso-scale, appropriately informed by data or models to provide 
predictive or fundamental insight that will work effectively in concert 
with data-centric, experimental, and theoretical efforts to discover new
 materials, new states of matter, or advance understanding of materials 
properties and phenomena and their control through structure, applied 
fields, or other means. Computational efforts may include models that 
apply across or at multiple scales of length or time, and may include 
different chemistry or physics models to capture specific processes or 
phenomena. Creativity and innovation are encouraged to obtain the 
maximum predictive power or insight through computation, data-centric 
methods, and theory to achieve the goals of DMREF.</p>

<p>DMREF will enable the development of new data analytic tools and 
statistical algorithms; advanced simulations of material properties in 
conjunction with new device functionality; advances in predictive 
modeling that leverage machine learning, artificial intelligence, data 
mining, and sparse approximation; data infrastructure that is 
accessible, extensible, scalable, and sustainable; the development, 
maintenance, and deployment of reliable, interoperable, and reusable 
software for the next-generation design of materials; and new 
collaborative capabilities for managing large, complex, heterogeneous, 
distributed data supporting materials design, synthesis, and 
longitudinal study. Incorporation of cyberinfrastructure developed 
through NSF investments including the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/goodbye?https://openkim.org/">OpenKIM</a> Knowledge-base of Inter-atomic Models, Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf15553">SI2</a>), Data Infrastructure Building Blocks (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf16530">DIBBs</a>), and Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf18531">CSSI</a>), is encouraged where appropriate.</p>

<p>DMREF aligns with national priorities for advanced manufacturing and 
future industries, national defense and homeland security, information 
technologies and high performance computing, human health and welfare, 
clean energy, and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics 
(STEM). While this solicitation is not restricted to any particular 
materials research topic, those of particular interest in this FY2019 
solicitation include: 1) Synthetic materials biology, 2) Structural 
materials under extreme conditions, 3) Recyclable plastics and 
alternative materials for sustainable development, and 4) Robotic 
materials. By facilitating interdisciplinary integrative materials 
research, DMREF is supportive of the NSF long-range transformative 
agenda, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/big_ideas/">"Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments"</a>.</p>


<p>The multidisciplinary character of this effort dictates the 
involvement of programs in the NSF Directorates of Mathematical and 
Physical Sciences, Engineering, and Computer and Information Science and
 Engineering. Awards are expected to range from $1,000,000 – $1,750,000 
over four years. To cover the breadth of this endeavor, it is expected 
that proposed projects will be directed by a team of at least two Senior
 Personnel with complementary expertise.</p>

<p>Assuming that sufficient funding is provided in the NSF budget, it is
 anticipated that the DMREF program will continue with competitions 
biennially in odd-numbered years.</p>

<p>In FY 2019, the DMREF program pilots a cloud option in partnership with Google.</p>

<h3><a name="pgm_desc_txt" id="pgm_desc_txt"></a>II. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</h3>

<div>
<p>DMREF will support activities that significantly accelerate materials
 discovery and/or development by building the fundamental knowledge base
 needed to design and make materials and/or devices with specific and 
desired functions or properties. This will be accomplished through 
forming interdisciplinary teams of researchers working synergistically 
in a "closed loop" fashion, building a vibrant research community, 
leveraging data science, providing ready access to materials data, and 
educating the future MGI workforce. Specifically, achieving this goal 
will involve modeling, analysis, and computational simulations, 
validated and verified through sample preparation, characterization,

<p>Computational efforts will begin at the smallest appropriate length

<p>DMREF will enable the development of new data analytic tools and 
statistical algorithms; advanced simulations of material properties in 
conjunction with new device functionality; advances in predictive 
modeling that leverage machine learning, artificial intelligence, data 
mining, and sparse approximation; data infrastructure that is

maintenance, and deployment of reliable, interoperable, and reusable 
software for the next-generation design of materials; and new 
collaborative capabilities for managing large, complex, heterogeneous, 
distributed data supporting materials design, synthesis, and 
longitudinal study. Incorporation of cyberinfrastructure developed 
through NSF investments including the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/goodbye?https://openkim.org/">OpenKIM</a> Knowledge-base of Inter-atomic Models, Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf15553">SI2</a>), Data Infrastructure Building Blocks (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf16530">DIBBs</a>), and Cyberinfrastructure for Sustained Scientific Innovation (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf18531">CSSI</a>), is encouraged where appropriate.</p>

<p>DMREF aligns with national priorities for advanced manufacturing and 
future industries, national defense and homeland security, information 
technologies and high performance computing, human health and welfare, 
clean energy, and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics 
(STEM). Proposals may address any materials class, provided that they 
describe transformative scientific or engineering advances enabled by 
the DMREF philosophy described above. DMREF encourages the submission of
 proposals that align with materials aspects of NSF's long-range 
transformative agenda, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/big_ideas/">"Big Ideas for Future NSF Investments"</a>.
 In addition, the development of fundamental understandings related to 
materials and/or the engineering of their associated properties for four
 strategic potential application areas have been prioritized for this 
competition:</p>

<ol>

<li>Synthetic Materials Biology: This effort will converge the SynBio 
research communities (Biologists and System Engineers) with materials 
researchers both to identify materials challenges hindering advancement 
of SynBio, as well as to generate new SynBio approaches to advanced 
material development.</li>
<li>Structural Materials under Extreme Conditions: This effort addresses
 fundamental challenges in ceramic, metallic, and polymeric materials 
and their composites for applications under extreme conditions.</li>
<li>Recyclable Plastics and Alternative Materials for Sustainable 
Development: This effort includes a) fundamental challenges in the 
development of intrinsically recyclable polymers, b) better 
understanding of mechanisms controlling the properties of recycled 
plastic products, c) strategies to understand and improve the properties
 of recycled plastics, and d) building the knowledge necessary for 
development of alternative materials in plastic applications.</li>
<li>Robotic Materials: This effort addresses fundamental challenges for 
the discovery, development, and engineering of materials and their 
associated properties that will be necessary to tightly integrate 
sensing, actuation, computation, and communication in order to 
ultimately harvest, metabolize, and store energy to power computers that
 interact with sensors and actuators affecting the physical properties 
of a system.</li>
</ol>

<p>The DMREF program will support, but is not limited to, efforts that 
span research in materials, chemistry, physics, mathematics, biology, 
computer science, and engineering, thereby bridging Program and 
Divisional interests. Proposal review will be coordinated and funded 
among the participating NSF Programs and Divisions, as appropriate. The 
complexity and challenge of activities addressed by this initiative 
require a transformative interdisciplinary approach to discovering and 
developing new materials, predicting and optimizing properties of 
materials, and informing the design of material systems. Accordingly, 
the proposed research must involve a collaborative and iterative 
'closed-loop' process wherein theory guides computational simulation, 
computational simulation guides experiments, and experimental 
observation further guide theory. Strategies must be included in the 
proposed research to advance knowledge related to materials design 
through synthesis / growth / processing techniques, characterization / 
testing methodology, theory / mathematics, data science, and computation
 / simulation approaches needed to develop reliable predictive 
computational and/or data models or to assist in simplifying the 
analysis of multidimensional input data.</p>

<p>This collaborative and iterative process will require a team of PIs 
with the requisite expertise. Accordingly, it is expected that proposed 
projects will be directed by a team of at least two Senior Personnel 
with complementary expertise. The proposal must provide a plan for 
comprehensive data management that ensures transparency, data sharing, 
and open source software, including an explicit statement of which open 
source license(s) and repositories, if applicable, will be used. Chapter
 II, Section C.2.j of the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=pappg">Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide (PAPPG)</a>
 details expectations of the required Data Management Plan, which will 
be thoroughly evaluated for DMREF proposals. While not required, ties 
with industry, national laboratories, and/or other federal MGI-partners 
are encouraged. If there are strong collaborations with industry, Grant 
Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=pappg">PAPPG</a>
 Chapter II, Section E.4) can be used in conjunction with this effort. 
Collaborative Proposals involving two or more academic institutions may 
also be appropriate (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=pappg">PAPPG</a>
 Chapter II, Section D.3). In light of DMREF's emphasis on an integrated
 approach to materials science and engineering research, 
cross-disciplinary educational and public outreach activities are 
encouraged. As such, proposals are strongly encouraged to describe 
substantial efforts to enhance the development of a next-generation 
workforce that is prepared to advance materials science and engineering 
research with an integrated approach consistent with the aims of the 
MGI.</p>

<p>NSF will support DMREF through well-coordinated activities involving 
the Directorates of Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS), 
Engineering (ENG), and Computer and Information Science and Engineering 
(CISE). Within MPS, the Divisions of Materials Research (DMR) and 
Mathematical Sciences (DMS) will participate. The Divisions of Civil, 
Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation (CMMI), Electrical, 
Communication and Cyber Systems (ECCS), and Chemical, Bioengineering, 
Environmental and Transport Systems (CBET) in ENG will participate. 
Within CISE the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC), Computing 
and Communication Foundations (CCF), Computer and Network Systems (CNS),
 and Information and Intelligent Systems (IIS) will participate. PIs 
should select as the primary Unit of Consideration the participating 
Division with which the topic of the proposal is most closely aligned. 
Awards are expected to range from $1,000,000 – $1,750,000 over a 
duration of four years.</p>

<p>Subject to the availability of funds, it is anticipated that the 
DMREF program will continue with competitions biennially in odd-numbered
 years.</p>

<p><strong><em>Opportunity for PIs to Engage with Google Resources</em></strong></p>

<p>In FY 2019, the program features support for a cloud option. Google 
Cloud is participating in the program to provide cloud credits/resources
 to projects that require significant storage and computational 
resources. The objective is to encourage projects that focus on 
large-scale experimentation and scalability studies. If additional cloud
 providers join the program, resources/credits from those providers will
 be available under the same terms and conditions as described in this 
solicitation.</p>

<p>While the technical description and justification for use of cloud 
resources would be expected to be part of the Project Description, 
details of the cloud resource costing and annual cloud resource usage 
must be included in the Supplementary Documents section. See Section 
V.A., Cloud Costing and Annual Usage Plan, for details on how to provide
 this information.</p>

<p>The minimum cloud resource request for a project is $8,000, 
regardless of the NSF budget request. This is because the objective is 
to support either large-scale or data-complex experimentation through 
use of cloud resources, and not "routine" use. The cloud credit/resource
 request, typically in the range $8,000 to $10,000, but up to a maximum 
of $20,000, should not appear in the NSF Budget pages nor in the NSF 
Budget Justification section, but rather under Supplementary Documents 
as described in Section V.A of the solicitation.</p>

<p>The technical justification for use of cloud resources that is

<p><strong><em>Special Instructions for Proposals Selecting the Office 
of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC) as the Primary Unit of 
Consideration</em></strong></p>

<p>DMREF topics of special interest to OAC include, but are not limited to, software and data components with the <em>potential</em> to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Become part of a comprehensive, integrated, sustainable, and secure 
research cyberinfrastructure (CI) at the national or international 
scale;</li>
<li>Extend benefits across multiple science disciplines;</li>
<li>Enhance existing research CI investments; and</li>
<li>Transition from prototypes to robust, usable, reusable components applicable to effective practice.</li>
</ul>

<p>DMREF-OAC awardees will be encouraged to address and report on a set 
of cyberinfrastructure-specific requirements as a condition of the 
award. Such awardees will also be invited to participate in the 
principal investigators' meeting for the Cyberinfrastructure for 
Sustained Scientific Innovation (CSSI) program.</p>

<p>Participants interested in selecting OAC as the primary Unit of 
Consideration are strongly encouraged to confer with the cognizant OAC 
Program Officer listed above.</p>

<p>Co-funding from OAC may be available to teams that, in their Data 
Management Plan: 1) state the specific open-source or other license(s) 
under which developed code will be released, 2) describe plans to 
transition the software to sustainability after NSF funds have ended, 
and 3) define community usage metrics for each year of the award. These 
simple, but well thought out metrics should demonstrate what will be 
accomplished each year and should show the impact of the software on the
 breadth of the user/developer community. Potential metrics include the 
number of individuals or research groups using the software, the number 
of citations, and the number of contributors.</p>

either be identical to the current project or altered to address new 
challenges. For Renewal proposals, the Results from Prior NSF Support 
section must substantially address progress made under the current DMREF
 award with respect to Intellectual Merit, Broader Impacts, and DMREF 
Solicitation Specific Review Criteria. Furthermore, a clear explanation 
of how MGI principles are being applied to accelerate materials 
discovery and development, and a detailed vision for advancement along 
the Materials Development Continuum (as described in the <a href="http://www.nist.gov/mgi/upload/MGI-StrategicPlan-2014.pdf">MGI Strategic Plan</a>)
 toward eventual deployment, must be provided. 2) Members of a DMREF 
team may submit a New proposal. The new topic could either be unrelated 
to the existing project or represent a significant change in technical 
direction, perhaps resulting from insights gained from the current 
project. The team for the new proposal may either be identical to the 
existing team or altered to address the new goals. For New proposals, 
the Results of Prior NSF Support section should still address progress 
made under the existing DMREF project with respect to Intellectual 
Merit, Broader Impacts, and DMREF Solicitation Specific Review Criteria.</p>

<p><strong>Cover Sheet:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Unit of Consideration.</strong> At least one participating 
NSF Division from the drop-down list in FastLane must be selected as the
 Unit of Consideration. The first Unit of Consideration selected must be
 the participating NSF Division aligned most closely with the topic of 
the proposal. Additional Units of Consideration aligned with the topic 
of the proposal may also be selected. Grants.gov users should refer to 
Section VI.1.2. of the NSF Grants.gov Application Guide for specific 
instructions on how to designate the NSF Unit of Consideration.</li>
<br>

<li>Adherence to these requirements will guide NSF Program Officers in 
establishing an appropriate review for the proposal. This information 
will be used for guidance in the review process, but will not 
necessarily reflect the Division that will ultimately process the 
proposal. It is anticipated that proposals on topics situated at the 
boundaries between two or more Divisions may be co-reviewed by those 
Divisions.</li><br>

<li><strong>Proposal Title.</strong> The title of the proposal must begin with '<strong>DMREF:</strong>'
 followed by the project title. Proposals submitted by different 
institutions as a collaborative group must have the identical title that
 begins with the designation '<strong>DMREF: Collaborative Research:</strong>'. Titles of proposals involving <strong>GOALI</strong>, must begin with '<strong>DMREF: GOALI:</strong>', or '<strong>DMREF: Collaborative Research: GOALI:</strong>'.</li>
<br>

<li><strong>Collaborative Proposals.</strong> All collaborative 
proposals submitted as separate submissions from multiple organizations 
must be submitted via the NSF FastLane system. All proposals in a 
collaborative group must select the same Units of Consideration in the 
same sequence. Chapter II, Section D.3 of the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=pappg">Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide (PAPPG)</a> provides additional information on Collaborative Proposals.</li>
<br>

<li><strong>Senior Personnel.</strong> All DMREF proposals must involve 
at least two Senior Personnel (PI, Co-PI, Faculty, or Other Senior 
Personnel) to ensure that all aspects of the project (synthesis / growth
 / processing, characterization / testing, theory / data / computation /
 simulation) are adequately covered by relevant expertise. These 
partnerships may occur through either a proposal from a single 
institution or one involving multiple institutions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Compliance with these Cover Sheet specifications is critical to 
determining the relevant proposal processing guidelines. Failure to 
submit this information may delay processing or result in the proposal 
being returned without review.</p>

<p><strong>Project Summary:</strong> The final line of the Overview 
portion of the Project Summary must be a list of no more than five key 
words preceded by the phrase or heading <strong>Key Words</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Project Description:</strong> The Project Description must 
include a brief description of the management plan for the collaboration
 preceded by the phrase or heading <strong>Management Plan</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Budget:</strong> Develop a realistic project budget that is 
consistent with the proposed activities. Proposed budgets should include
 funds for travel by one PI or co-PI to attend a biennial MGI Principal 
Investigator Meeting held in even-numbered years.</p>

<p><strong>Single Copy Documents:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Required</strong>: Information regarding collaborators and 
other affiliations (COA) must be provided for each individual identified
 as senior project personnel according to the instructions provided in 
Chapter II.C.1.e of the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=pappg"><em>NSF Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide</em> </a>(PAPPG).</li>
<br>

<li><strong>Optional</strong>: suggested Reviewers and Reviewers Not to Include.</li>
</ul>

<p>Single Copy Documents above are used by NSF staff, but are not available to reviewers.</p>

<p><strong>Supplementary Documents</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Letters of Collaboration</strong>: For proposals involving 
collaborations with researchers not listed as co-PIs, proposers should 
include letters confirming the collaborations. The letters must be very 
brief and contain no statements of support or reference. Details about 
collaborative work to be done under this project should be included 
within the 15 pages of the Project Description, not in the letter(s) of 
collaboration.</li>
<br>

<li><strong>Cloud Costing and Annual Usage Plan - Required of proposals requesting the cloud option (2 page limit)</strong>:
 Projects that intend to request Google cloud resources must include a 
detailed costing, showing a credit usage/resource consumption plan with 
the amount and type of storage, compute, and network resources (and any 
other necessary cloud resources that incur costs) to be used during each
 year of the project. These costs will not be reflected in the 
proposal';s budget. As part of their proposal development process, a PI 
may contact Google to ensure that the planned request for Google cloud 
resources is technically feasible and can be satisfied by Google. The 
two essential items of the costing plan are: 1) The total cost of cloud 
resources-showing the distribution across storage, compute, and network,
 etc., resources and 2) the annual usage plan, i.e., how much of these 
credits/resources will be used each year.<p></p>

<p>Separately, in addition to the 2-page Cloud Costing and Annual Usage 
Plan that is included in the Supplementary Documents, potential users of
 Google cloud resources must compile and submit an Excel Workbook using 
the tabular format found at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cise/iis/cloudrequestform.xlsx">https://www.nsf.gov/cise/iis/cloudrequestform.xlsx</a>, which contains a single-tab template. The completed workbook must be submitted via email to <a href="mailto:dmref@nsf.gov">dmref@nsf.gov</a>
 within five business days of the last day of the solicitation 
submission window. The completed workbook must include the FastLane 
proposal ID (which is assigned after the proposal is submitted to NSF).</p></li>


<li><strong>Data Management Plan (DMP)</strong>: The Office of Budget Finance and Award Management (BFA) at NSF provides direction on the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp">Dissemination and Sharing of Research Results</a>. The NSF <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=pappg">Data Sharing Policy</a>(PAPPG Chapter XI.D.4) and NSF <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=pappg">Data Management Plan Requirements</a>
 (PAPPG Chapter II.C.2.j) provide the basis for an effective Data 
Management Plan. PIs are encouraged to carefully examine both NSF Data 
Sharing Policy and NSF Data Management Plan Requirements in the PAPPG. 
DMPs are of particular relevance to DMREF; consistent with the pivotal 
role of data in the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI), which has 
inspired this program. DMPs will be an important component of the 
proposals considered in this competition throughout the Merit Review 
process.</li>

<h3>VI. NSF PROPOSAL PROCESSING AND REVIEW PROCEDURES</h3>

<p>Proposals received by NSF are assigned to the appropriate NSF program
 for acknowledgement and, if they meet NSF requirements, for review. All
 proposals are carefully reviewed by a scientist, engineer, or educator 
serving as an NSF Program Officer, and usually by three to ten other 
persons outside NSF either as <em>ad hoc</em> reviewers, panelists, or 
both, who are experts in the particular fields represented by the 
proposal. These reviewers are selected by Program Officers charged with 
oversight of the review process. Proposers are invited to suggest names 
of persons they believe are especially well qualified to review the 
proposal and/or persons they would prefer not review the proposal. These
 suggestions may serve as one source in the reviewer selection process 
at the Program Officer's discretion. Submission of such names, however, 
is optional. Care is taken to ensure that reviewers have no conflicts of
 interest with the proposal. In addition, Program Officers may obtain 
comments from site visits before recommending final action on proposals.
 Senior NSF staff further review recommendations for awards. A flowchart
 that depicts the entire NSF proposal and award process (and associated 
timeline) is included in PAPPG Exhibit III-1.</p>

<p>A comprehensive description of the Foundation's merit review process is available on the NSF website at: <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/">https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/merit_review/</a>.</p>

<p>Proposers should also be aware of core strategies that are essential to the fulfillment of NSF's mission, as articulated in <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf18045"><em>Building the Future: Investing in Discovery and Innovation - NSF Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years (FY) 2018 – 2022</em></a>.
 These strategies are integrated in the program planning and 
implementation process, of which proposal review is one part. NSF's 
mission is particularly well-implemented through the integration of 
research and education and broadening participation in NSF programs, 
projects, and activities.</p>

<p>One of the strategic objectives in support of NSF's mission is to 
foster integration of research and education through the programs, 
projects, and activities it supports at academic and research 
institutions. These institutions must recruit, train, and prepare a 
diverse STEM workforce to advance the frontiers of science and 
participate in the U.S. technology-based economy. NSF's contribution to 
the national innovation ecosystem is to provide cutting-edge research 
under the guidance of the Nation's most creative scientists and 
engineers. NSF also supports development of a strong science, 
technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by investing 
in building the knowledge that informs improvements in STEM teaching and
 learning.</p>

<p>NSF's mission calls for the broadening of opportunities and expanding
 participation of groups, institutions, and geographic regions that are 
underrepresented in STEM disciplines, which is essential to the health 
and vitality of science and engineering. NSF is committed to this 
principle of diversity and deems it central to the programs, projects, 
and activities it considers and supports.</p>

<h4><a name="reviewcrit"></a>A. Merit Review Principles and Criteria</h4>

<p>The National Science Foundation strives to invest in a robust and 
diverse portfolio of projects that creates new knowledge and enables 
breakthroughs in understanding across all areas of science and 
engineering research and education. To identify which projects to 
support, NSF relies on a merit review process that incorporates 
consideration of both the technical aspects of a proposed project and 
its potential to contribute more broadly to advancing NSF's mission "to 
promote the progress of science; to advance the national health, 
prosperity, and welfare; to secure the national defense; and for other 
purposes." NSF makes every effort to conduct a fair, competitive, 
transparent merit review process for the selection of projects.</p>

<p><strong>1. Merit Review Principles</strong></p>

<p>These principles are to be given due diligence by PIs and 
organizations when preparing proposals and managing projects, by 
reviewers when reading and evaluating proposals, and by NSF program 
staff when determining whether or not to recommend proposals for funding
 and while overseeing awards. Given that NSF is the primary federal 
agency charged with nurturing and supporting excellence in basic 
research and education, the following three principles apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>All NSF projects should be of the highest quality and have the 
potential to advance, if not transform, the frontiers of knowledge.</li>
<li>NSF projects, in the aggregate, should contribute more broadly to 
achieving societal goals. These "Broader Impacts" may be accomplished 
through the research itself, through activities that are directly 
related to specific research projects, or through activities that are 
supported by, but are complementary to, the project. The project 
activities may be based on previously established and/or innovative 
methods and approaches, but in either case must be well justified.</li>
<li>Meaningful assessment and evaluation of NSF funded projects should 
be based on appropriate metrics, keeping in mind the likely correlation 
between the effect of broader impacts and the resources provided to 
implement projects. If the size of the activity is limited, evaluation 
of that activity in isolation is not likely to be meaningful. Thus, 
assessing the effectiveness of these activities may best be done at a 
higher, more aggregated, level than the individual project.</li>
</ul>

<p>With respect to the third principle, even if assessment of Broader 
Impacts outcomes for particular projects is done at an aggregated level,
 PIs are expected to be accountable for carrying out the activities 
described in the funded project. Thus, individual projects should 
include clearly stated goals, specific descriptions of the activities 
that the PI intends to do, and a plan in place to document the outputs 
of those activities.</p>

<p>These three merit review principles provide the basis for the merit 
review criteria, as well as a context within which the users of the 
criteria can better understand their intent.</p>

<p><strong>2. Merit Review Criteria</strong></p>

<p>All NSF proposals are evaluated through use of the two National 
Science Board approved merit review criteria. In some instances, 
however, NSF will employ additional criteria as required to highlight 
the specific objectives of certain programs and activities.</p>

<p>The two merit review criteria are listed below. <strong>Both</strong> criteria are to be given <strong>full consideration</strong>
 during the review and decision-making processes; each criterion is 
necessary but neither, by itself, is sufficient. Therefore, proposers 
must fully address both criteria. (PAPPG Chapter II.C.2.d(i). contains 
additional information for use by proposers in development of the 
Project Description section of the proposal). Reviewers are strongly 
encouraged to review the criteria, including PAPPG Chapter II.C.2.d(i), 
prior to the review of a proposal.</p>

<p>When evaluating NSF proposals, reviewers will be asked to consider 
what the proposers want to do, why they want to do it, how they plan to 
do it, how they will know if they succeed, and what benefits could 
accrue if the project is successful. These issues apply both to the 
technical aspects of the proposal and the way in which the project may 
make broader contributions. To that end, reviewers will be asked to 
evaluate all proposals against two criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The Intellectual Merit criterion encompasses the potential to advance knowledge; and</li>
<li><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> The Broader Impacts criterion 
encompasses the potential to benefit society and contribute to the 
achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following elements should be considered in the review for both criteria:</p>

<ol>
<li>What is the potential for the proposed activity to<ol type="a">
<li>Advance knowledge and understanding within its own field or across different fields (Intellectual Merit); and</li>
<li>Benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes (Broader Impacts)?</li>
</ol></li>
<li>To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts?</li>
<li>Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, 
well-organized, and based on a sound rationale? Does the plan 
incorporate a mechanism to assess success?</li>
<li>How well qualified is the individual, team, or organization to conduct the proposed activities?</li>
<li>Are there adequate resources available to the PI (either at the home
 organization or through collaborations) to carry out the proposed 
activities?</li>
</ol>

<p>Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, 
through the activities that are directly related to specific research 
projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are 
complementary to, the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific 
knowledge and activities that contribute to achievement of societally 
relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full 
participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented 
minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); 
improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased
 public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and 
technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development 
of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased 
partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national 
security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and 
enhanced infrastructure for research and education.</p>

<p>Proposers are reminded that reviewers will also be asked to review 
the Data Management Plan and the Postdoctoral Researcher Mentoring Plan,
 as appropriate.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Solicitation Specific Review Criteria</strong></p>

<p>The following additional criteria will be used to evaluate all DMREF proposals:</p>

<ul>
<li>How effectively does the proposed work help accelerate materials 
discovery, understanding, and/or development by building the fundamental
 knowledge base needed to progress toward designing and making materials
 with specific, desired functions or properties?</li>
<li>How effectively does the proposed research use collaborative 
processes with iterative feedback among tasks? The materials synthesis /
 growth / processing techniques, characterization / testing methodology,
 theory / mathematics, data science, and computation / simulation 
aspects of the project must all strongly interact with each other to 
promote significant advances in each of these components and advance 
materials design.</li>
<li>How effectively does the proposed work provide training for the next
 generation of scientists and engineers, educated in a 
multidisciplinary, integrated experimental and computational approach to
 materials research? Has adequate data-related training been provided 
for students and postdoctoral researchers, as needed?</li>
<li>How effectively does the proposed work and corresponding data 
management plan provide open access to outputs, including data, 
software, codes, samples, and publications?</li>
</ul>

<p>If Google credits are requested, reviewers will also evaluate how effectively will they be used. Specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>The appropriateness of the request.</li>
<li>Whether use of the Google resources has been adequately justified.</li>
<li>Whether the estimate of the amount of resources needed and the 
corresponding resource request budget (in dollars) have been properly 
calculated.</li>
<li>Whether the request is consistent with a sound Data Management Plan where data will be adequately curated and shared.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the case of renewal proposals, reviewers will also evaluate:</p>

<ul>
<li>Progress made during the previous award (as described in the Results from Prior NSF Support section of the proposal); and</li>
<li>The plan for advancing materials discovery and development along the Materials Development Continuum (as described in the <a href="https://www.mgi.gov/sites/default/files/documents/mgi_strategic_plan_-_dec_2014.pdf">MGI Strategic Plan</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to being evaluated according to the previously described 
criteria, proposals submitted to the Division of Mathematical Sciences 
(DMS) as the Primary Unit of Consideration will be evaluated with 
respect to whether they seek new mathematical or statistical results 
that will advance the DMREF agenda. These proposals will be co-evaluated
 by other divisions in the areas of science and engineering where 
impacts of the projects are expected.</p>

<p>Proposals submitted to the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure 
(OAC) as the Primary Unit of Consideration will be co-evaluated by other
 divisions in the areas of science and engineering where impacts of the 
projects are expected. These proposals will be further evaluated based 
on the extent to which they:</p>

<ul>
<li>Become part of a comprehensive, integrated, sustainable, and secure 
research cyberinfrastructure (CI) at the national or international 
scale;</li>
<li>Extend benefits across multiple science disciplines;</li>
<li>Enhance existing research CI investments; and</li>
<li>Transition from prototypes to robust, usable, reusable components applicable to effective practice.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="reviewprot" id="reviewprot"></a>B. Review and Selection Process</h4>

<p>Proposals submitted in response to this program solicitation will be reviewed by Ad hoc Review and/or Panel Review.</p>

<p>Reviewers will be asked to evaluate proposals using two National 
Science Board approved merit review criteria and, if applicable, 
additional program specific criteria. A summary rating and accompanying 
narrative will generally be completed and submitted by each reviewer 
and/or panel. The Program Officer assigned to manage the proposal's 
review will consider the advice of reviewers and will formulate a 
recommendation.</p>

<p>After scientific, technical and programmatic review and consideration
 of appropriate factors, the NSF Program Officer recommends to the 
cognizant Division Director whether the proposal should be declined or 
recommended for award. NSF strives to be able to tell applicants whether
 their proposals have been declined or recommended for funding within 
six months. Large or particularly complex proposals or proposals from 
new awardees may require additional review and processing time. The time
 interval begins on the deadline or target date, or receipt date, 
whichever is later. The interval ends when the Division Director acts 
upon the Program Officer's recommendation.</p>

<p>After programmatic approval has been obtained, the proposals 
recommended for funding will be forwarded to the Division of Grants and 
Agreements for review of business, financial, and policy implications. 
After an administrative review has occurred, Grants and Agreements 
Officers perform the processing and issuance of a grant or other 
agreement. Proposers are cautioned that only a Grants and Agreements 
Officer may make commitments, obligations or awards on behalf of NSF or 
authorize the expenditure of funds. No commitment on the part of NSF 
should be inferred from technical or budgetary discussions with a NSF 
Program Officer. A Principal Investigator or organization that makes 
financial or personnel commitments in the absence of a grant or 
cooperative agreement signed by the NSF Grants and Agreements Officer 
does so at their own risk.</p>

<p>Once an award or declination decision has been made, Principal 
Investigators are provided feedback about their proposals. In all cases,
 reviews are treated as confidential documents. Verbatim copies of 
reviews, excluding the names of the reviewers or any 
reviewer-identifying information, are sent to the Principal 
Investigator/Project Director by the Program Officer. In addition, the 
proposer will receive an explanation of the decision to award or decline
 funding.</p>

<h3><a name="awardadmin" id="awardadmin"></a>VII. AWARD ADMINISTRATION INFORMATION</h3>

<h4><a name="awardnotify" id="awardnotify"></a>A. Notification of the Award</h4>

<p>Notification of the award is made to <em>the submitting organization</em>
 by a Grants Officer in the Division of Grants and Agreements. 
Organizations whose proposals are declined will be advised as promptly 
as possible by the cognizant NSF Program administering the program. 
Verbatim copies of reviews, not including the identity of the reviewer, 
will be provided automatically to the Principal Investigator. (See 
Section VI.B. for additional information on the review process.)</p>

<h4><a name="grantcond" id="grantcond"></a>B. Award Conditions</h4>

<p>An NSF award consists of: (1) the award notice, which includes any 
special provisions applicable to the award and any numbered amendments 
thereto; (2) the budget, which indicates the amounts, by categories of 
expense, on which NSF has based its support (or otherwise communicates 
any specific approvals or disapprovals of proposed expenditures); (3) 
the proposal referenced in the award notice; (4) the applicable award 
conditions, such as Grant General Conditions (GC-1)*; or Research Terms 
and Conditions* and (5) any announcement or other NSF issuance that may 
be incorporated by reference in the award notice. Cooperative agreements
 also are administered in accordance with NSF Cooperative Agreement 
Financial and Administrative Terms and Conditions (CA-FATC) and the 
applicable Programmatic Terms and Conditions. NSF awards are 
electronically signed by an NSF Grants and Agreements Officer and 
transmitted electronically to the organization via e-mail.</p>

<p>*These documents may be accessed electronically on NSF's Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF">https://www.nsf.gov/awards/managing/award_conditions.jsp?org=NSF</a>. Paper copies may be obtained from the NSF Publications Clearinghouse, telephone (703) 292-7827 or by e-mail from <a href="mailto:nsfpubs@nsf.gov">nsfpubs@nsf.gov</a>.</p>

<p>More comprehensive information on NSF Award Conditions and other 
important information on the administration of NSF awards is contained 
in the NSF <em>Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide</em> (PAPPG) Chapter VII, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=pappg">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=pappg</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Special Award Conditions:</strong></p>

<p>NSF awardees receiving Google Cloud Platform credits will be required
 to accept Google Cloud Platform Terms of Service located at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/cgi-bin/goodbye?https://cloud.google.com/terms/">https://cloud.google.com/terms/</a>
 prior to using any Google Cloud Platform resources. These projects will
 be required to include appropriate acknowledgment of both NSF and 
Google support in reports and/or publications on work performed under 
the awards. An example of such an acknowledgement would be: "This 
material is based upon work supported by the NSF under Award No. 
[Recipient enters awards number(s)], through use of resources provided 
by Google in partnership with the NSF [participating program name] 
program."</p>

<h4><a name="reportreq" id="reportreq"></a>C. Reporting Requirements</h4>

<p>For all multi-year grants (including both standard and continuing 
grants), the Principal Investigator must submit an annual project report
 to the cognizant Program Officer no later than 90 days prior to the end
 of the current budget period. (Some programs or awards require 
submission of more frequent project reports). No later than 120 days 
following expiration of a grant, the PI also is required to submit a 
final project report, and a project outcomes report for the general 
public.</p>

<p>Failure to provide the required annual or final project reports, or 
the project outcomes report, will delay NSF review and processing of any
 future funding increments as well as any pending proposals for all 
identified PIs and co-PIs on a given award. PIs should examine the 
formats of the required reports in advance to assure availability of 
required data.</p>

<p>PIs are required to use NSF's electronic project-reporting system, 
available through Research.gov, for preparation and submission of annual
 and final project reports. Such reports provide information on 
accomplishments, project participants (individual and organizational), 
publications, and other specific products and impacts of the project. 
Submission of the report via Research.gov constitutes certification by 
the PI that the contents of the report are accurate and complete. The 
project outcomes report also must be prepared and submitted using 
Research.gov. This report serves as a brief summary, prepared 
specifically for the public, of the nature and outcomes of the project. 
This report will be posted on the NSF website exactly as it is submitted
 by the PI.</p>

<p>More comprehensive information on NSF Reporting Requirements and 
other important information on the administration of NSF awards is 
contained in the <em>NSF Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide</em> (PAPPG) Chapter VII, available electronically on the NSF Website at <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=pappg">https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=pappg</a>.</p>

<p>Annual Reports from projects that benefit from Google Cloud Platform 
credits must provide a detailed accounting of the project's use of 
Google resources.</p>

<h3>ABOUT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION</h3>

<p>The National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent Federal 
agency created by the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, as 
amended (42 USC 1861-75). The Act states the purpose of the NSF is "to 
promote the progress of science; [and] to advance the national health, 
prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all 
fields of science and engineering."</p>

<p>NSF funds research and education in most fields of science and 
engineering. It does this through grants and cooperative agreements to 
more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 school systems, businesses,
 informal science organizations and other research organizations 
throughout the US. The Foundation accounts for about one-fourth of 
Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.</p>

<p>NSF receives approximately 55,000 proposals each year for research, 
education and training projects, of which approximately 11,000 are 
funded. In addition, the Foundation receives several thousand 
applications for graduate and postdoctoral fellowships. The agency 
operates no laboratories itself but does support National Research 
Centers, user facilities, certain oceanographic vessels and Arctic and 
Antarctic research stations. The Foundation also supports cooperative 
research between universities and industry, US participation in 
international scientific and engineering efforts, and educational 
activities at every academic level.</p>

<p><em>Facilitation Awards for Scientists and Engineers with Disabilities</em>
 (FASED) provide funding for special assistance or equipment to enable 
persons with disabilities to work on NSF-supported projects. See the <em>NSF Proposal &amp; Award Policies &amp; Procedures Guide</em> Chapter II.E.6 for instructions regarding preparation of these types of proposals.</p>

<p>The National Science Foundation has Telephonic Device for the Deaf 
(TDD) and Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) capabilities that 
enable individuals with hearing impairments to communicate with the 
Foundation about NSF programs, employment or general information. TDD 
may be accessed at (703) 292-5090 and (800) 281-8749, FIRS at (800) 
877-8339.</p>
