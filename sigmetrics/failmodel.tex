\section{Constrained Preemptions of Google Preemptible VMs}
\label{sec:preemption-dynamics}

%Understanding the nature and dynamics of transient cloud servers such as their preemption frequency is a prerequisite to understand and improve the performance of applications.

%This is presumably in the background 
\eat{In order to understand and improve the performance of applications running on transient cloud servers, we must understand the nature and dynamics of their preemptions.
The preemption characteristics are governed by the supply of surplus resources, the demand for cloud resources, and the resource allocation policies enforced by the cloud operator.
Therefore, in this section, we present empirical and analytical models to help us understand the nature of preemptions.

To measure and improve the performance of applications running on transient cloud servers, it is critical to understand the nature and dynamics of their preemptions. 
%The preemption characteristics are governed by the supply of surplus resources, the demand from applications, and resource allocation policies of the cloud operator.
In this section, we present empirical analysis of preemptions of Google Preemptible VMs, and develop new probabilistic models of their preemption rates.  
%that describe these characteristics and enable an intuitive understanding of the nature of preemptions. 


% Transient cloud servers, by their very nature have limited availability and are frequently preempted.
% These preemptions are akin to fail-stop failures, and are often preceeded by a small advance warning (few seconds) to allow for graceful shutdowns.

% Since preemptions can impact the availability, performance, and cost of running applications, in this section, we examine their preemption characteristics.
% This modeling is important, because having a model of the availability can be useful in the context of predicting the running times of applications.
% Cloud providers offer a large number of servers of different configurations and types.
% Since transient server availability is fundamentally tied to supply and demand, the availability of servers of different types can be significantly different. 
% Thus, selecting the ``right'' server type is crucial for minimizing the overall costs.

\end{figure}

To understand the nature of temporally constrained preemptions, we conducted the first empirical study of Google's Preemptible VMs, that have a fixed price and a maximum 24 hour lifetime.
Our empirical study is necesitated by the fact that the cloud operator (Google) does not disclose any other information about the preemption rates, and thus relatively little is known about the preemptions (and hence the performance) of these VMs.


We launched more than 1,500 Google Preemptible VMs of different types over a two month period (Feb--April 2019), and measured their time to preemption (i.e., their useful lifetime).\footnotemark

A sample of over 100 such preemption events are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:gcp1}, which shows cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the VM lifetimes of the \texttt{n1-highcpu-16} VM in the \texttt{us-east1-b} zone. 
%enter the type of VM for which the data is shown
Note that the cloud operator (Google) caps the \emph{maximum} lifetime of the VM to 24 hours, and all the VMs are preempted before that limit. 

\noindent \textbf{Observation 1:} \emph{The lifetimes of VMs are not uniformly distributed, but have three distinct phases.}

\noindent In the first (initial) phase, characterized by VM lifetime $t\in [0, 3]$ hours, we observe that many VMs are quickly preempted after they are launched, and thus have a steep rate of failure (derivative of the CDF) initially.
%; the rate of failure or preemptions can be obtained by taking the derivative of the CDF. 
In the second phase, VMs that survive past 3 hours enjoy a relatively low preemption rate over a relatively broad range of lifetime (characterized by the slowly rising CDF in Figure~\ref{fig:gcp1}).
The third and final phase exhibits a steep increase in the number of preemptions as the preemption deadline of 24 hours approaches.
The overall rate of preemptions is ``bathtub'' shaped as shown in the inset of Figure~\ref{fig:gcp1}.
%\it I think we should show the probability plot to exhibit the bath tub shape

%The preemption rate is ``bath tub'' shaped, with VMs that survive past 3 hours enjoying a relatively low preemption rate, and finally a steep increase in the number of preemptions as the preemption deadline (24 hours) approaches. 


\noindent \textbf{Observation 2:} \emph{The preemption behavior, imposed by the constraint of the small 24 hour  lifetime, is substantially different from conventional failure characteristics of hardware components and even EC2 spot instances.}

\noindent In ``classical'' reliability analysis, the rate of failure  usually follows an exponential distribution $f(t) = \lambda e^{-\lambda t}$, where $\lambda=1/\text{MTTF}$.
Figure~\ref{fig:gcp1} shows the CDF ($=1-e^{-\lambda t}$) of the exponential distribution when fitted to the observed preemption data, by finding the distribution parameter $\lambda$ that minimizes the least squares error.
The classic exponential distribution is unable to model the observed preemption behavior because it assumes that the rate of preemptions is independent of the lifetime of the VMs, i.e., the preemptions are \emph{memoryless}.
%The primary reason is that the exponential distribution assumes that the \vj{the rate of preemptions is independent of the lifetime of the VMs} (preemptions are \emph{memoryless}), which does not hold true when there is a fixed upper bound on the lifetime, as is the case for Google Preemptible VMs. \vj{In other words, the conventional approach is insufficient to model constrained preemption dynamics.}
%We attribute this deficiency to the central assumption made in the underlying reliability theory principles that leads to the classical exponential distribution: the rate of preemptions is independent of the lifetime of the VMs, in other words, the preemptions are \emph{memoryless}.
This assumption breaks down when there is a fixed upper bound on the lifetime, as is the case for Google Preemptible VMs, and the conventional approach becomes insufficient to model this constrained preemption dynamics. 

\noindent \textbf{Observation 3:} \emph{The bathtub shaped preemption behavior is a general, universal characteristic of Preemptible VMs.}

In general, the preemption dynamics of a VM is determined by the supply and demand of VMs of that \emph{particular} type.
Thus, our empirical study looked at preemptions of VMs of different sizes, in different geographical zones, at different times of the day, and running different workloads (Figure \textbf{YYY}).
In all cases, we find that the preemption behavior is bathtub shaped and has the three preemption phases. 
We argue that this is not a coincindence, but may be a result of practical and fundamental outcomes of cluster management policies. 

While the actual specific preemption policy is up to the cloud operator, we will show that the bathtub behavior has benefits for applications. 
%The bathtub behavior results in a high rate of failure initially. 
For applications that do not incorporate explicit fault-tolerance (such as checkpointing), early preemptions result in less wasted work than if the preemptions were uniformly distributed over the 24 hour interval.
Furthermore, the low rate of preemptions in the middle periods allows jobs that are smaller than 24 hours to finish execution with only a low probability of failure, once they survive the initial preemption phase. 
We compare job performance with bathtub shaped preemptions vs. uniform preemption rates in Section Evaluation.

%We can define the wasted work of a job of length J as E[Wasted_J] = integ_{0}^{J} P(t)t dt . where P(t) is probability of failure at time t . We can see from the figure that the wasted work is smaller in the case of the bathtub shaped distribution compared to the uniform failure rate. 

In addition to being beneficial to applications, we also conjecture that the bathtub behavior is a \emph{fundamental} characteristic of any system where events are randomly distributed in a finite interval.
Intriguingly, we can analyze such temporally constrained preemptions through a statistical mechanics framework, and we elaborate on this connection later in Section~\ref{subsec:statmech}. 


\noindent \textbf{Observation 4:}\emph{ Larger VMs have a higher rate of preemptions.}

\noindent Figure~\ref{fig:cdf-comparison} shows the preemption data from five different types of VMs in the Google Cloud \texttt{n1-highcpu-\{2,4,8,16,32\}}, where the number indicates the number of CPUs.
All VMs are running in the \texttt{us-central1-c} zone. 
We see that the larger VMs (16 and 32 CPUs) have a higher probability of preemptions compared to the smaller VMs.
While this could be simply due to higher demand for larger VMs, it can also be explained from a cluster management perspective. 
Larger VMs require more computational resources (such as CPU and memory), and when the supply of resources is low, the cloud operator can quickly reclaim a large amount of resources by preempting larger VMs.
This observed behavior aligns with the guidelines for using preemptible VMs that suggests the use of smaller VMs when possible~\cite{preemptible-documentation}. 

\noindent \textbf{Observation 5:} \emph{Preemptions exhibit diurnal variations, and are also affected by the workload inside the VM.}

\noindent From Figure~\ref{fig:time-breakdown}, we can see that VMs have a slightly longer lifetime during the night (8 PM to 8 AM) than during the day.
This is expected because fundamentally, the preemption rates are higher during periods of higer demand. 

We also notice that completely idle VMs have longer lifetimes than VMs running some workload.
Presumably, this could be a result of the lower resource utilization of idle VMs being more amenable to resource overcommitment, and result in lower preemptions.

\subsection{Failure Probability Model}
\label{subsec:analytical-model}


  
%Based on our empirical analysis of preemptions,  
We now develop an analytical probability model for preemption dynamics that is faithful to the empirically observed data and provides a basis for developing running-time and cost-minimizing optimizations. %
Modeling temporally constrained preemptions raises many challenges for existing preemption models that have been used for other transient servers such as EC2 spot instances. 
We first discuss why existing approaches to preemption modeling are not adequate, and then present our closed-form probability model. 

%How to avoid sounding like the background section?

\subsubsection{Inadequacy of existing failure distributions}

Spot instance preemptions have been modeled using exponential distribution~\cite{sigcomm-bidcloud, hotcloud-notbid, flint}, which is the default in most reliability theory applications. 
However, the strict 24 hour constraint and the distinct preemption phases are not compatible with the memoryless properties of the exponential distribution. 
%
To describe failures (preemptions) that are not memoryless (i.e., increasing or decreasing failure rate over time), the classic Weibull distribution with CDF $F(t)=1-e^{-(\lambda t)^k}$ is often employed. However, the Weibull distribution is also unable to fit the empirical data (Figure~\ref{fig:gcp1}) and especially unable to model the sharp increase in preemptions near the 24 hour deadline. 

For constrained preemptions, the increase in failure rate as modeled by the Weibull distribution is not high enough.
Other distributions, such as Gompertz-Makeham, have also been used for modeling bathtub behavior, especially  for actuarial use-cases.
The key idea is to incorporate an exponential aging process, which is used to model human mortality.
The CDF of the Gompertz-Makeham distribution is given by $F(t) = 1 - \exp\left(-\lambda t - \dfrac{\alpha}{\beta}(e^{\beta t} - 1) \right)$
  and is fitted to the data in Figure XXX, and is also unable to provide a good model for the observed preemption data. 

%Specifically, it is unable to model the bathtub preemption rate and the different preemption phases, and 


%We also analyze other distributions used for modeling bathtub failures from reliability and actuarial theory in Figure \textbf{XXX}.


The non-trivial bathtub-shaped failure rate of Google preemptible VMs (Figure~\ref{fig:gcp1}) requires models that capture the sudden onset of the rise in preemptions near the deadline.
From an application and transiency policy perspective, the preemption model must provide insights about the phase transitions, so that the application can adapt to the sharp differences in preemption rates.
%
For example, the preemption model should be able to warn applications about impending deadline, which existing failure distributions cannot account for. 
% which imposes a dynamics that is more akin to a constrained dynamics problem as opposed to dynamics characterized with a gradually rising failure rate.
Thus, not only is it important to minimize the total distribution fitting error, it is also important to capture the changes in phase.
However, as we can see from the \textbf{QQ plots}, existing distributions are unable to capture the effects of the deadline and the phases of the preemptions, and a new modeling approach is needed, which we develop next.  

\subsubsection{Multiple failure rate model}



%This is especially important from a policy design perspective, as the ``phase changes'' in preemption behavior can greatly affect the failure probability and performance of applications.
%Our new model, informed by the cumulative distribution of lifetimes that has multiple distinct temporal phases, addresses this need.

Our failure probability model seeks to address the drawbacks of existing reliability theory models for modeling constrained preemptions. 
The key assumption underlying our model is the presence of two distinct failure processes.
%that give rise to a new probability distribution characterizing the preemptions and the observed CDF, and ensure the dependence of the rate of failure on the VM lifetime. 
The first process dominates over the initial temporal phase and yields the classic exponential distribution that captures the high rate of early preemptions.
The second process dominates over the final phase near the 24 hour maximum VM lifetime and is assumed to be characterized by an exponential term that captures the sharp rise in preemptions that results from this constrained lifetime. 
%Generally, these two processes jointly determine the dynamics of preemptions during the middle phase where a relatively constant or a slowly rising number of preemptions with time is observed.
%; in practice, based on the fits to the empirical data, we observe the first process to dominate over the second during this phase as well. 

%The first two phases are reasonably captured by the classic exponential distribution. In order to model the overall observed empirical CDF, we add another term that captures the failure process near the 24 hour maximum VM lifetime,  and construct a \emph{new} probability distribution. 
%
%we develop a \emph{new} probability distribution that is composed by blending two failure processes that act on different temporal phases over the 24 hour maximum lifetime of the VMs. 
%
%We write the general form of our blended preemption CDF as follows:

Based on these observations, we propose the following general form for the CDF:

\vspace*{\subsecspace}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:blend1}
  \boxed{
  \mathscr{F}\left(t\right) = A\left(1-e^{-\frac{t}{\tau_1}} + e^{\frac{t-b}{\tau_2}}\right)}
  \end{equation}
\noindent where $t$ is the time to preemption, $1/\tau_1$ is the rate of preemptions in the initial phase, $1/\tau_2$ is the rate of preemptions in the final phase, $b$ denotes the time that characterizes ``activation'' of the final phase where preemptions occur at a very high rate, and $A$ is a scaling constant.
In practice, typical fit values yield $b \approx 24$ hours, and $\tau_2 \approx 1$ hour, which ensures that our proposed distribution meets the initial condition $\mathscr{F}(0) \approx 0$.

%of  0 $\approx 0$ premptions.
%used to scale the CDF to ensure that the initial conditions ($F(0)=0$) are met.

For most of its life, a VM sees failures according to the classic exponential distribution with a rate of failure equal to $1/\tau_1$ -- this behavior is captured by the $1-e^{-t/\tau_1}$ term in Equation~\ref{eq:blend1}. 
%However, this does not capture the finite lifetime of the VM imposed by the cloud operator.
As VMs get closer to their maximum lifetime imposed by the cloud operator, they are reclaimed (i.e., preempted) at a high rate $1/\tau_2$, which is captured by the second exponential term, $e^{(t-b)/\tau_2}$ of Equation~\ref{eq:blend1}. 
Shifting the argument ($t$) of this term by $b$ ensures that the exponential reclamation is only applicable near the end of the VM's maximum lifetime and does not dominate over the entire temporal range. 
%As noted before, $1/\tau_2$ is the rate of this reclamation. 

The analytical model and the associated  distribution function $\mathscr{F}$ introduced above provides a much better fit to the empirical data (Figure~\ref{fig:gcp1}) and captures the different phases of the preemption dynamics through parameters $\tau_1, \tau_2, b$, and $A$. These parameters can be obtained for a given empirical CDF using least squares function fitting methods. The failure or preemption rate can be derived from this CDF as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:failrate}
    \vspace*{\eqnspace}
f(t) = \dfrac{d \mathscr{F}(t)} {dt} = A \left(\dfrac{1}{\tau_1}e^{-t/\tau_1} + \dfrac{1}{\tau_2}e^{\frac{t-b}{\tau_2}}\right).
\end{equation}
$p(t)$ vs. $t$ yields a bathtub type failure rate function for the associated fit parameters (inset of Figure~\ref{fig:gcp1}).
%In the next section, we use this analytical model for optimizing cloud resource selection to run scientific computing applications at low cost and shorter running (turnaround) times.


In the absence of any prior work on constrained preemption dynamics, our aim is to provide an interpretable model with a minimal number of parameters, that provides a sufficiently accurate characterization of observed preemptions data. 
%As is evident from Figure~\ref{fig:gcp1}, our model shows deviations from the data near the halfway point within the 24 hour lifetime. 
Further generalization of this model to include more failure processes would introduce more parameters and reduce the generalization power.
Exploring other approaches of modeling bathtub-type failure rates (e.g., exponential Weibull distributions) \cite{mudholkar1993exponentiated,crevecoeur1993model} is part of our future work. 


\subsubsection{Reliability Analysis}


We now analyze and place our model in a reliability theory framework. 
%

\noindent \textbf{Expected Lifetime:} Our analytical model also helps crystallize the differences in VM preemption dynamics, by allowing us to easily calculate their expected lifetime. 
More formally, we define the expected lifetime of a VM of type $i$, as: 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:expected-lifetime}
E[L_i] =  \int_{0}^{24} t {f_i}(t)~dt =  -A(t+\tau_1)e^{-t/\tau_1} + A(t-\tau_2) e^{\frac{t-b}{\tau_2}} \biggr\rvert_{0}^{24}
\end{equation}
where $f_i(t)$ is the rate of preemptions of VMs of type $i$ (Equation~\ref{eq:failrate}).
%= \dfrac{d \mathscr{F}(t)} {dt} = A \left(\dfrac{1}{\tau_1}e^{-t/\tau_1} + \dfrac{t-b}{\tau_2}e^{\frac{t-b}{\tau_2}}\right) $ 
%
%Since preemptions require restarting a job and increase the job completion time, it may be more prudent to select transient VMs with higher expected lifetimes.

This expected lifetime can be used in lieu of MTTF, for policies and applications that require a ``coarse-grained'' comparison of the preemption rates of servers of different types, which is a key requirement in cost-minimizing server selection, which we develop later in Section. 

%We use the analytically derived expected lifetimes of VMs of different types in \sysname when selecting the ``best'' VM type for a given bag of jobs. This server selection is a key part of \sysname design. 

\noindent \textbf{Hazard Rate:}
We now compute the hazard rate of our model, which is defined as  $\lambda(t) = \frac{S(t)}{f(t)}$, where $S(t) = 1 - F(t)$ is the survival function.
The hazard rate also related to the CDF as follows: $1-F(t) = \exp{\int_0^t{-\lambda(x) ~dx}}$. 

The hazard rate governs the dynamics of the failure processes.
For example, the exponential distribution has a constant hazard rate $\lambda$.
The Gompertz-Makeham distribution has an increasing failure rate to account for the increase in mortality, and its hazard rate is given by $\lambda(t) = \lambda + \alpha e^{\beta t}$.
Since we model multiple failure rates and deadline-driven preemptions, our hazard rate also increases with time, and can be computed by simplifying $\lambda(t) = \dfrac{- r_1 e^{- r_1 t} - r_2 e^{r_2 (t -
    b)}}{e^{- r_1 t} - e^{r_2 (t - b)}}$. 

\noindent After algebraic simplification, we get a more interpretable hazard rate for our model:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:hmodel}
  \lambda = r_2 + \bar{r} \left( \dfrac{1}{1 - e^{- r_2 b} e^{\bar{r} t}}\right)
  = \dfrac{r_1 + r_2 e^{- r_2 b} e^{\bar{r} t}}{1 - e^{- r_2 b} e^{\bar{r} t}}  
\end{equation}
Here, $\bar{r} = r_1 + r_2$, ie., the sum of the two failure rate constants.

For ease of exposition, we can write this as:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:hmodelsimple}
\lambda =  \dfrac{r_1 + \gamma_1 e^{\delta (t-b)}}{1 - \gamma_2 e^{\delta (t-b)}}
\end{equation}

We note that the numerator is  similar to the hazard rate of Gompertz-Makeham.
The key difference is the $1-\gamma_2 e^{t-b}$ factor in the denominator. 
Recall that the sharp increase in preemption rate only happens close to the deadline, which means that $b \leq 24$. Thus, when $t < b$, we get a conventional $\lambda = r_1$, or the classic exponential distribution.
As $t$ approaches and exceeds $b$, the increase in failure rate kicks in, accounting for the deadline-driven rise in preemptions. 



% We emphasize that our motivation is to develop an interpretable \emph{minimal} model that provides a sufficiently accurate description of the observed constrained preemption dynamics of Google VMs with a minimal number of meaningful parameters. 
% As is evident from Figure~\ref{fig:gcp1}, $\mathscr{F}$ shows deviations from the data near the halfway point within the 24 hour lifetime.
% Further generalization of this model to include more failure processes, which would introduce more parameters, or exploring other approaches of modeling bathtub-type failure rates (e.g., exponential Weibull distributions) \cite{mudholkar1993exponentiated,crevecoeur1993model} may yield alternate model descriptions that capture the data with higher accuracy.


%PXXX part of future work? 

%characterized by failure rates and activation times (like $b$). 
%and reduce the predictive power and simplicity of the model. 
%We also note that approaches (e.g., exponential Weibull distributions) to model bathtub-type failure rates have been proposed in the literature  \cite{mudholkar1993exponentiated,crevecoeur1993model}.
%These methods did not perform better than our model resulting in parameter variables and values that were relatively difficult to interpret; this could likely be due to the unique constraint-driven failures in preemption dynamics as opposed to aging-related increasing failure rate considered in previous work. 

\subsection{Role of Cloud Providers: Analogy to Constrained Physical Systems}

The bathtub-shaped distribution of the preemption probability is essential to capture the empirical data with higher accuracy compared to other models. We want to probe the following question now: how much of this unique shape is enforced by the cloud provider, and how much is dictated by assuming that (akin to other cloud providers such as EC2), preemptions of Google Preemptible VMs are placed along the timeline of 24 hours with uniform probability? We make the question more precise and inject a relatively harmless assumption: if the cloud provider decides to ``place'' $N$ preemptions within the temporal boundary of interval $L$ with flat probability distribution ($\mathscr{P}(e_1, e_2, \ldots e_N)$ = 1 whenever legal) such that the preemptions are mutually exclusive (that is there is a finite non-zero waiting time between preemptions), what is the probability of finding a preemption at time $t$? Naively, deducing from $\mathscr{P}$, one may expect $p(t)$ to be 1 for $t\in L$, or a constant (flat) distribution. However, intruigingly, this is not true. Thus, as we discuss in more detail below, the cloud provider may have the simplest of preemption policies implemented at their end, and yet give rise to the relatively complex and non-trivial probability to preemption. 

To understand the above assertions with a simple example that sheds further insights into the origins of the bathtub-shaped distribution, we discuss analogous questions in the context of general physical systems of constrained (confined) particles.
These systems are generally analyzed using the theoretical framework of statistical mechanics often complemented with associated particle dynamics simulations. We choose an exactly solvable and simple system of hard (non-overlapping) particles (or beads) confined to move in one dimension within a finite spatial interval to draw interesting connections. 

A simple mapping from the system of temporally-constrained preemptions in the cloud to the system of spatially-constrained particles within one-dimensional confinement can be established by assuming that the cluster management policy requires mutually exclusive preemptions.
This assumption helps cluster management by serializing VM preemptions and making cluster operations easier, and it reduces the challenges associated with reacting to simultaneous preemptions. 
The preemption events become hard particles that cannot overlap. The preemption probability distribution gets mapped to the density of $N$ particles, each modeled as a one-dimensional ``sphere'' of width $\sigma$, confined in a 1-dimensional interval (line segment) of length $L$. $L$ can be considered as corresponding to the deadline interval of 24 hours. $\sigma$ is equivalent to the length of the critical section, which is related to the preemption warning (30 seconds for Google PVMs). 

The particles are placed, one after another, at random positions. Configurations where any overlap is generated are not included. Thus particles will be placed with a flat probability distribution.
The question we are trying to simulate with this set up is the familiar one noted above: what is the probability $p(x)$ of finding a preemption at time $x$?

This problem can be solved by first defining a partition function for the system. And doing some neat math.

Present the solution

This distribution is \emph{not} uniform over the interval, but is higher towards the ends of the interval---analogous to the bath-tub shaped nature of preemptions! 

Discuss more.

We thus draw a few critical observations. An immediate inclincation may be to attribute the observed non-trivial bathtub-shaped preemption probability function to a uniquely designed and structured operational policy of the cloud provider. However, the above analysis shows that even with the vanilla operational policy of placing preemptions with a uniform probability distribution, the finite excluded temporal volume of preemptions in conjunction with the relatively short deadline (which together imply a high average preemption rate) enforce a bathtub-shape-like distribution for finding a preemption at time $t$. Clearly, this does not provide all the subtle features observed in the preemption data as well as the failure model. But even there, it enables to gauge the extent to which the provider has changed the policy on top of the simplest possible implementation.

The analytical framework suggests that the bath-tub shape of the probability distribution is the key characteristic of constrained preemptions.
Therefore, our approach will remain relevant in the face of future changes in preemption characteristics due to changes in cloud usage and operational policies.



%These systems underlie a variety of phenomena in chemical and materials engineering applications such as ions confined in nanochannels \cite{jing,solis}. 

%In addition to empirically-informed reliability models for preemptions, we also seek to understand \emph{why} their distribution is bathtub shaped in order to provide a mechanistic understanding of preemptions and enhance the model interpretability and generalizability. 
%Our key insight is that the problem of analyzing constrained preemptions can be ``mapped'' to an equivalent problem in statistical mechanics of a physical system, and we can use the theoretical and analytical framework of statistical mechanics to develop a broader understanding of preemptions. 
%This connection to statistical mechanics is given below. 
%To this end, we propose to ``map'' the problem of constrained preemptions to an equivalent problem of constrained many particle physical systems that can be analyzed employing the general theoretical framework of statistical mechanics.

%A simple mapping can be established by assuming that the cluster management policy requires mutually exclusive preemptions.
%This assumption helps cluster management by serializing VM preemptions and making cluster operations easier, and it reduces the challenges associated with reacting to simultaneous preemptions. The preemption events become hard particles that cannot overlap. The probability distribution of $N$ constrained preemption events gets mapped to the density of $N$ randomly distributed particles confined in a 1-dimensional interval of length $L$ (analogous to 24 hours). 
%The particle size is equivalent to the length of the critical section, which is related to the preemption warning (30 seconds for Google PVMs).
%Finding the distribution of non-overlapping (i.e., hard) particles is a central problem in statistical mechanics [5].
%Interestingly, the distribution of particles in a confined interval can be obtained analytically via the exact closed-form expression of the so-called partition function (a common statistical mechanical quantity useful for obtaining the microscopic understanding of macroscopic phenomena).
%This distribution is \emph{not} uniform over the interval, but is higher towards the ends of the interval---analogous to the bath-tub shaped nature of preemptions! 

%The analytical framework suggests that the bath-tub shape of the probability distribution is the key characteristic of constrained preemptions.
%Therefore, our approach will remain relevant in the face of future changes in preemption characteristics due to changes in cloud usage and operational policies.


% \subsection{EC2 spot instances}

% The earliest form of transient cloud instances.
% In addition to having dynamic availability, also have dynamic pricing.
% ``Classic'' spot instances had price determining the availability, and thus a large amount of work was devoted to bidding and analyzing the prices.

% However a recent change to the spot prices no longer allows these assumptions, rendering it impossible to obtain the \emph{exact} availability information from the prices alone.


% \subsection{Google Preemptible VMs}

% Launched in 2015.
% Flat-rate discount of 80\% compared to on-demand servers.
% Interesting availability SLA: the maximum lifetime is 24 hours, and can be preempted earlier as well.

% In this paper we will look at these preemptible VMs and show how to model their availability.
% Given the inability to use EC2 prices, we believe that our approach is more generalizable and robust.


% There are some distinguishing characteristics of GCP preemptible VMs that makes their failure modeling challenging.
% First is their flat pricing and no other signalling information about their preemption rates (MTBFs) that makes server selection difficult.

% \textbf{Modeling Failure Behavior of Preemptible VMs}
% CDF is ``sigmoid'' shaped.
% $P=R*np.sinh((t-t0)/tau) + C$ with a very low $R=10^{-6}, t_0=12, \tau=0.9, C=0.36$

% Basically, this is a mixture of two distributions, the standard exponential distribution, which we call the stabilization rate and an exponentially increasing reclamation rate.

% Preemptible VMs have three availability phases.

% There are many early deaths, then a period of low failure rates, and then the failure rate is exponential with a positive exponent to enable the cloud provider to reclaim the VMs within the deadline (24 hours in the case of Google's Preemptible VMs).
