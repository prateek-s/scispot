Transient cloud servers such as Amazon Spot instances, Google Preemptible VMs, and Azure Low-priority batch VMs, can reduce cloud computing costs by as much as $10\times$, but can be unilaterally preempted by the cloud provider.
Understanding preemption characteristics (such as frequency) is a key first step in minimizing the effect of preemptions on application performance, availability, and cost. 
In this paper, we conduct a first of its kind empirical, statistical, and analytical study of the preemption behavior of Google's Preemptible VMs, 
that have a distinguishing characteristic of having a \emph{maximum} lifetime of 24 hours. 
This temporal constraint introduces many challenges in preemption modeling, since existing memoryless models are not applicable. 

We develop a probability model of constrained preemptions that is based on a large scale empirical study of over 1,500 VM preemptions. 
Our statistical analysis indicates that preemptions are \emph{not} uniformly distributed, but have distinct temporal phases, which introduces new challenges in failure modeling.  
Our preemption model uses insights from reliability theory and  statistical mechanics. 
To highlight the effectiveness of our model, we develop optimized policies for job scheduling and checkpointing for constrained preemptions. 
Compared to existing preemption modeling techniques, our model-based policies can reduce the running time of jobs on preemptible VMs by up to $5\times$, and reduce the probability of job failure by more than $2\times$. 
We also implement our policies as part of a batch computing service, which can reduce the cost by $5\times$ compared to conventional cloud deployments.



% Our statistical analysis shows that preemptions are not uniformly distributed over the 24 hour interval, but instead 

% The rise in transient computing has led to the creation of many systems and techniques, that all depend on probabilistic modeling of preemptions in order to minimize their disruptive effects. 


% However, because Google's preemptible VMs have a maximum lifetime of 24 hours, existing models of preemptions are not applicable, and we lack fundamental understanding of preemptions and their impact on application behaviour and performance. 

% To model the unique, fixed lifetime of Preemptible VMs, we propose modeling techniques that are rooted in reliability theory and statistical mechanics.
% Proposed research is foundational and delivers the \emph{first} analytical model for preemption dynamics in Google Preemptible VMs.  
% Using the model-driven insights and mechanistic understanding, we develop optimized policies for cloud resource management and fault-tolerance, and implement them as part of a \emph{new} cloud-based software framework for running parallel scientific computing applications. 



%Although transient servers can be used to lower the costs of running scientific computing applications on the cloud, their frequent preemptions and resource heterogeneity makes their effective and efficient use challenging.
