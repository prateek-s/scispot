\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
The effective use of transient computing relies on understanding the preemption characteristics.
While past work on transient computing has developed techniques and systems for Amazon's EC2 spot instances, ours is the \emph{first} work to understand the behavior of Google's Preemptible VMs, that have a unique characteristic of having a maximum 24 hour lifetime.
Our large-scale empirical study shows that the constraint imposes a bathtub failure distribution, and we develop a new premption probability model for capturing its three distinct temporal phases. 
Our insights and model-based policies can reduce the preemption overheads by more than $5\times$ compared to existing preemption models, and our batch computing service can reduce computing costs by over $5\times$. 

%Constrained preemptions are a relatively unexplored phenomenon and challenging to model. Our model and the associated data expand transient cloud computing to beyond EC2-spot. We have evaluated the model under different practical conditions including different VM types and temporal domains, and have shown it to be general and robust.
