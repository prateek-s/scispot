Increase the usability and viability of cloud resources for scientific applications.

Resource and cost management, automation. Abstractions. 

Middleware. HPC as a service.


This paper combines and integrates instance selection, fault-tolerance policies, and application-specific policies.

Prior approaches have largely explored each of these facets individually, and running scientific workloads in the cloud has not received the attention that it warrants.

We show that costs in the cloud can be reduced by up to $10\times$ with the combination of smart server selection, preemption aware resource allocation, and ``job-importance'' thresholds for job-groups.
