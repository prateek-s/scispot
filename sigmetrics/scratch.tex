Increase the usability and viability of cloud resources for scientific applications.

Resource and cost management, automation. Abstractions. 

Middleware. HPC as a service.


This paper combines and integrates instance selection, fault-tolerance policies, and application-specific policies.

Prior approaches have largely explored each of these facets individually, and running scientific workloads in the cloud has not received the attention that it warrants.

We show that costs in the cloud can be reduced by up to $10\times$ with the combination of smart server selection, preemption aware resource allocation, and ``job-importance'' thresholds for job-groups.

The preemptions of transient servers need not be related to their price.
-For example, Google's Preemptible VMs and Azure Batch VMs have a \emph{fixed} price relative to their non-preemptible counterparts. 
-In such cases, price-based models are inadequate, and other approaches to understand preemptions are required.
 
-This task is further complicated by the fact that these cloud operators (Google and Microsoft) do not currently provide any information about preemption characteristics. 
-Thus, relatively little is known about the preemptions (and hence the performance) of these transient VMs. %significantly limiting their use?
-%
-To understand preemption dynamics of transient servers, we conduct a large-scale empirical measurement study. 
 We launched more than 1,500 Google Preemptible VMs of different types over a two month period (Feb--April 2019), and measured their time to preemption (i.e., their useful lifetime).\footnotemark

-To describe failures (preemptions) that are not memoryless (i.e., increasing or decreasing failure rate over time), the classic Weibull distribution with CDF $F(t)=1-e^{-(\lambda t)^k}$ is often employed. However, the Weibull distribution is also unable to fit the empirical data (Figure~\ref{fig:gcp1}). 
-
-The non-trivial bathtub-shaped failure rate of Google preemptible VMs (Figure~\ref{fig:gcp1}) requires models that capture the sudden onset of  the rise in preemptions near the deadline. 
-%which imposes a dynamics that is more akin to a constrained dynamics problem as opposed to dynamics characterized with a gradually rising failure rate.
-Our new model, informed by the cumulative distribution of lifetimes that has multiple distinct temporal phases, addresses this need. The key assumption underlying our model is the presence of two distinct failure processes.

-% Since cloud platforms support a wide range of applications, they also offer a large range of servers (VMs) with different resource configurations (such as the number of CPU cores, memory size, I/O bandwidths, etc.). 
-% For example, a cloud provider may offer VMs with (4 CPUs, 4 GB memory), (8 CPUs, 8 GB memory), etc.
-% Most clouds offer a large number of different hardware configurations---Amazon EC2 offers more than 50 hardware configurations, for example~\cite{amazon-ec2-instance-types}.
