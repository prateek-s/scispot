% Physical insights in constrained preemption dynamics
% 

Our accelerated aging model for constrained preemptions is able to give us insight into the preemption dynamics and helps in modeling expected lifetimes and other system resource allocation, scheduling, and checkpointing policies.

In this section, we present a discussion of \emph{why} constrained preemptions are

attempt to present an intuition behind the model and
