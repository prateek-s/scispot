\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Given the dramatic rise of cloud computing resources and their utilization in web services and distributed data processing, it is not the question of if, but when, cloud computing becomes a credible and powerful alternative to high-performance computing for scientific computing applications.
In this paper, we developed principled approaches for deploying and orchestrating scientific computing applications on the cloud, and presented \sysname, a framework for low-cost scientific computing on  transient cloud servers.
