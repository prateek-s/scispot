Transient cloud servers can yield significantly lower costs compared to traditional on-demand cloud servers. 
However, due to their preemptible nature and heterogeneity, their effective use remains challenging.

In this paper, we present SciSpot, a software framework for running scientific applications on transient cloud servers.

We perform a large-scale, first-of-its-kind empirical measurement and analytical modeling involving over a thousand Google preemptible VMs. 
Our policies for tackling the resource heterogeneity and transient availability of cloud VMs build on a key insight: most scientific computing applications are deployed as ``bag'' of jobs, which represent multiple instantiations of the same computation with different parameters.
We show that optimizing across an entire bag of jobs and being cognizant of the relation between different jobs in a bag, can enable simple and powerful policies for optimizing cost, makespan, and ease of deployment. 
SciSpot yields a cost saving of 70\% compared to traditional cloud deployments, and a makespan reduction of 20\% compared to a conventional HPC clusters.
