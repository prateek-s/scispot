\section{Checkpointing Policies}

High rate of failure means that especially for long jobs, checkpointing is necessary.
In this section, we develop checkpointing policies.

At a high level, we only checkpoint long jobs, based on the probability of preemption.

Once checkpointing for a job is enabled, we use proactive periodic checkpointing.

DMTCP is used for checkpointing MPI programs.

Conventionally, periodic checkpointing according to Young-Daly formula: $\tau=\sqrt{2\cdot\delta\cdot\text{MTTF}}$.
This assumes that failure arrival process is exponentially distributed.

However, this may not always hold true.
Clearly, from Figure 1, the CDF is not exponential.

Much more strongly ``bath-tub''. Maybe can use exponentiated Weibull to model the failures.

Regardless, because it is not memoryless, the checkpointing interval cannot be uniform. Maybe can use~\cite{bougeret_checkpointing_2011}, which uses dynamic programming and also comes with a simulator of sorts.
