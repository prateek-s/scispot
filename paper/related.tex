\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Scientific applications on cloud}

A classic survey is ~\cite{iosup_performance_2011}
~\cite{zhai_cloud_2011}

Parameter sweep:~\cite{casanova_heuristics_2000}

Price optimizations for Scientific workflows in the cloud~\cite{gari_learning_2019}



\subsection{Transiency mitigation}

\cite{marathe2014exploiting} classic work on MPI and Spot.
Uses checkpointing.
Redundancy, but for what?
User specified number of VMs. Does not do instance selection. 
BCLR for checkpointing.



MOre spot and MPI:~\cite{gong_monetary_2015}. FOcussed on bidding and checkpoint interval. But bidding doesnt matter. 


\cite{xiang_spotmpi:_2011} is early work for spot and MPI and 

\cite{spoton} a batch computing service

Heterogenity often used, but not useful in the context of MPI jobs~\cite{exosphere}

Selecting the best instance type, often for data analysis computations~\cite{alipourfard_cherrypick}, and ~\cite{yadwadkar_selecting_2017}, and others like Ernest and Hemingway.


All the past work was on EC2 spot market with gang failures and independent markets~\cite{marathe2014exploiting, gong_monetary_2015}.
However this assumption has now changed, and failures can happen anytime.
Our failure model is more general, and applies to both cases.




\subsubsection{Fault-tolerance for MPI}

\cite{dongarra_fault_nodate} has a discussion of checkpointing frequency which is comprehensive.

Replication is another way~\cite{walters_replication-based_2009}


\subsubsection{Huge amount of work on bidding in HPC}

\cite{wolski_probabilistic_2017}

\cite{guo_bidding_2015}


\subsection{Server Selection}
Exploring a large configuration space using bayesian optimization methods in CherryPick~\cite{cherrypick} and Metis~\cite{Metis-atc18}.

Can also use Latin Hypercube sampling for parameter exploration?
