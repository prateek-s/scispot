\section{Evaluation}

The contenders:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Run every job on un-tuned on-demand instance (cost and running time)
\item Run every job on nanohub/big-red-2 (running and waiting time)
\item Run on transient, restart every time (cost)
\item SciSpot with early stopping and job sacrificing 
\end{enumerate}
