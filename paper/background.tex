\subsection{Transient Computing}

\subsection{Heterogeneity and Parallel Scientific Applications in the Cloud}

\subsection{Case Study: Molecular Dynamics Applications}
Describe the kind of computation.

Scaling properties. Almost perfectly scalable with O(n) communication? 

This can be a like a case study of parallel scientific simulations.
Will help relate to parameters etc with more concrete examples.

Bag of jobs.
Why multiple runs: parameter sweeps, search, or just multiple times to get confidence intervals and stable results in case of randomness. 

\begin{comment}

- sweep, to get parameter set suitable
- important part of workflow
- exploring 
- ML ICCS application, training the ML model, new trend
- critical to develop ML wrappers for simulations on HPC
- ML IJHPCA
