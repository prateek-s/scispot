\subsection{Transient Computing}

\subsection{Heterogeneity and Parallel Scientific Applications in the Cloud}

\subsection{Case Study: Molecular Dynamics Applications}
Describe the kind of computation.

Scaling properties. Almost perfectly scalable with O(n) communication? 

This can be a like a case study of parallel scientific simulations.
Will help relate to parameters etc with more concrete examples.
