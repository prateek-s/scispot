\section{Introduction}

% Look, scientific applications are important, OK? And HPC. 

Scientific computing applications play a critical role in understanding natural and synthetic phenomena associated with a wide range of material, biological, and engineering systems. 
The computational models and simulations for analyzing these systems can consume a large amount of computing resources, and require access to large dedicated high performance computing (HPC) infrastructure. 



%such as supercomputers~\cite{bigred2}.


% VJ: perhaps it could be useful to point out that the cloud approach will not require any further code changes like one encounters in moving from sequential to MPI appraoch; but it would need a framework innovation

% But now we have the cloud!!1

Increasingly, cloud computing platforms have begun to supplement and complement conventional HPC infrastructure  to meet the large computing and storage requirements of scientific applications~\cite{buyya-hpc-survey}. 
Public cloud platforms such as Amazon's EC2, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure, offer multiple benefits such as \emph{on-demand} resource allocation, convenient pay-as-you-go pricing models, ease of provisioning and deployment, and near-instantaneous elastic scaling. 
Most cloud platforms offer \emph{Infrastructure as a Service}, and provide computing resources in the form of \emph{Virtual Machines (VMs)},  which run a wide range of applications such as web-services, distributed data processing, distributed machine learning, etc.


% a wide range of applications.

To meet the diverse resource demands of different applications, public clouds offer resources (i.e., VMs) with multiple different resource configurations (such as number of CPU cores,  memory capacity, etc.), and pricing and availability contracts. 
Conventionally, cloud VMs have been offered with ``on-demand'' availability, such that the lifetime of the VM is solely determined by the owner of the VM (i.e., the cloud customer). 
Increasingly however, cloud providers have begun offering VMs with \emph{transient}, rather than continuous on-demand availability. 
Transient VMs can be unilaterally revoked and preempted by the cloud provider, and applications running inside them face fail-stop failures. 
Due to their volatile nature, transient VMs such as Amazon EC2 Spot instances~\cite{spot-documentation}, Google Preemptible VMs~\cite{preemptible-documentation}, and Azure Batch VMs~\cite{azure-batch}, are offered at steeply discounted rates ranging from 50 to 90\%.
%Amazon EC2 spot instances, Google Cloud Preemptible VMs, and Azure Batch VMs, are all examples of transient VMs, and are offered at discounts ranging from 50 to 90\%.  

% Very different from HPC and many challenges

However, deploying applications on cloud platforms presents multiple challenges due to the \emph{fundamental} differences with conventional HPC clusters---which most applications still assume as their default execution environment.
While the on-demand resource provisioning and pay-as-you-go pricing makes it easy to spin-up computing clusters in the cloud, the deployment of applications on cloud platforms must be cognizant of the heterogeneity in VM sizes, pricing, and availability for effective resource utilization. 
Crucially, optimizing for \emph{cost} in addition to performance, becomes an important objective in cloud deployments.
%
Although using transient resources can drastically reduce computing costs, their preemptible nature results in frequent job failures, and thus reduces their viability and usability. 
%

%While preemptions can be mitigated with additional fault-tolerance mechanisms and policies~\cite{flint, marathe2014exploiting}, these policies must be typically tailored to the application, and impose additional performance and deployment overheads, and thus reduce the viability and usability of transient resources. 

% \vj{\it add one more sentence}. 
%These considerations of cost, server configuration heterogeneity, and frequent job failures are intrinsic to transient servers, and  present multiple challenges in deploying applications on cloud platforms which are \emph{fundamentally} different from those that appear in using HPC clusters as the execution environment for the scientific computing applications.
% Finally getting to the point 

In this paper, we develop principled approaches for deploying and orchestrating  scientific computing applications on the cloud, and present \sysname, a framework for scientific computing on transient cloud servers.
%
\sysname introduces and incorporates policies for addressing the heterogeneity and preemptibiilty of transient cloud VMs, and is suitable for running a wide range of scientific applications at low-cost and with minimal performance overhead.
%
\sysname abstracts many popular scientific computing workloads and workflows into a new unit of execution, which we call as a ``bag of jobs''. 
These bags of jobs represent multiple instantiations of the same application launched with possibly different physical and computational parameters. 



%Where they are found. Needs to be crisper 

Bags of jobs are ubiquitous in scientific computing: for example, each job may be running a (parallel) simulation with a set of simulation input parameters, and different jobs in the collection (i.e., bag) run the same simulation with a different set of  parameters. 
Collectively, a bag of jobs can be used to ``sweep'' or search across a multi-dimensional parameter space to discover or narrow down the set of feasible and viable parameters associated with the modeled natural or synthetic processes.
A similar approach is adopted in the use of machine learning (ML) to enhance scientific computational methods, a rapidly emerging area of research~\cite{ml.atomic2017,melko2017,sam2017,fu2017,long2015machine, ferguson2017machine,ward2018matminer}, when a collection of jobs with independent parameter sets are launched to train ML models to predict simulation results and/or accelerate the simulation technique. 



While systems and techniques for mitigating transient server preemptions have received significant attention, prior work has mostly focussed on fault-tolerance and resource management for a \emph{single} job or application~\cite{spoton, exosphere, flint, marathe2014exploiting}. 
%Thus, while recently developed transiency mitigation techniques such as
For a bag of jobs, it is not necessary, or sufficient, to execute an individual job in timely manner---instead, we could selectively restart failed jobs in order to complete the necessary, desired subset of jobs in a bag.
Thus, while recently developed techniques such as transiency-aware checkpointing~\cite{marathe2014exploiting, flint}
and diversification~\cite{exosphere, spotweb} can indeed mitigate the effect of preemptions on \emph{single} jobs, these techniques are not suitable for the bags of jobs execution model. 


%
Furthermore, treating the bag of jobs as a fundamental unit of computation allows us to select the ``best'' server configuration for a given application, by exploring different servers for initial jobs and running the remainder of the jobs on the optimal server configuration. 
Unlike prior work that assumes that the optimal resource allocation for an application is known apriori, \sysname can find the optimal allocation in an online manner. 
Finally, \sysname runs applications on Google Cloud Preemptible VMs, and we develop the \emph{first} empirical and analytical models for understanding and characterizing their preemption dynamics, which informs our bags of jobs policies. 
%%
We implement these policies as part of the \sysname framework, and make the following contributions:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=12pt]
\item In order to select the optimal VM for an application, from the plethora of choices offered by cloud providers, we develop a transient VM selection policy that minimizes the cost of running applications. Our search based policy selects a transient VM based on it's cost, parallel speedup, and probability of preemption. 

% Yeah the "not spot" point below may need clarification before contribs
  
\item Since transient server preemptions can disrupt the execution of jobs, we present the \emph{first} empirical model and analysis of transient server availability that is \emph{not} rooted in classical bidding models for EC2 spot instances that have been proposed thus far. Our empirical model allows us to predict expected running and costs of jobs of different types and duration.

% WTF is even partial redundancy? 
  
\item We implement all our policies as part of a new framework, \sysname, and evaluate the cost and performance of different representative scientific computing  applications on the Google Cloud Platform. Compared to conventional cloud deployments, \sysname can reduce costs of running bags of jobs by more than $5\times$, and even when compared to dedicated HPC clusters, can reduce the total turnaround time by an order of magnitude. 

%\item Finally, ease of use and extensibility are one of the ``first principles'' in the design of \sysname, and we present the design and implementation of the system components and present case studies of how  scientific applications such as molecular dynamics simulations can be easily deployed on transient cloud VMs. 
\end{enumerate}

Running parallel scientific applications, such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, on low-cost cloud transient resources. 

The first "big" idea is that simulations are often bag of parallel tasks. 

While there has been some past work that looks at running MPI applications on spot instances, our scope is much broader and considers how complete simulation pipelines can be run at low cost. 

Spiel on transient instances. Increasingly popular resource allocation model that is being offered by all cloud providers. 
Very low cost compared to conventional cloud resources, often by up to 10x. 
However, can be frequently revoked. 
Thus failure is a common occurrence, and not a rare-event. 
This is especially challenging for MPI jobs because of its inability to tolerate failures. 

However, our insight is that while protecting a *single* job against revocations can require elaborate checkpointing based approaches, we dont necessarily have to do that if we consider that most simulations are composed of a series of jobs that search over a parameter space, and that what is important is the total running time and cost of this entire series of jobs. 

Thus, no single job is "special". 

Another aspect of novelty is that past work on transient resources used EC2 pricing information to get failure probabilities. However, this is no longer an accurate method. We perform the first empirical study of google preemptible VMs and their performance and availability for HPC workloads. 

Another fundamental question is what is a suitable metric in such cases. Conventionally, it is speedup. In the cloud, it is some combination of cost and running time. 


\sysname is a framework and a tool that combines the use of failure modeling, checkpointing, and application-aware early stopping, to provide low cost execution of jobgroups for scientific applications.


Our work is the first to make a principled study of transient instances \emph{other} than Amazon spot instances.
Furthermore, our techniques make the first stab at addressing the new problems in the new EC2 spot pricing scheme.

Our work is in the context of reliability and cloud execution of scientific applications, and is novel because of multiple reasons:
1. Reliability and failure analysis of parallel scientific applications usually studied in the context of hardware with MTTFs of centuries, which is several orders of magnitudes higher than MTTFs faced in transient cloud servers (few hours).

2. While there have been studies of scientific applications been deployed in the context of cloud platforms, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no effort that integrates server selection and running jobgroups in a convenient automatic manner that makes it feasible to actually deploy applications on the cloud for scientists who may not have the requisite cloud experience.

Notes:
  
For scientific applications, public clouds offer many advantages such as no waiting/queuing time and instant access to a wide range of resources, and pay as you go pricing. 
However, judicious use of cloud resources is necessary to achieve high performance and to avoid cost overruns.

Increasingly, cloud providers are offering transient VMs that are sold at steeply discounted rates of 90\%.
However, they can be unilaterally revoked by the cloud provider, resulting in preemptions which are akin to fail-stop failures.
This is 


The inspiration for our work is the massively parallel molecular simulation pipelines that have been proposed recently that call for a large number of simulation parameters to be evaluated.

However, the resource management and orchestration principles, techniques, and tools, are all different.
