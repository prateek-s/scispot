* 10 Create image with tested Nanoconfinement, shapes, and X 

* 9 Systemd restart on failure and pass -i 
** https://singlebrook.com/2017/10/23/auto-restart-crashed-service-systemd/

* 1 Exploration for confinement
Create a new master and use a different zone (central maybe)
Goal should be start using scispot code 
** CPU = 64 
*** On-demand and preemptible just to show equivalence 
** CPU = 128 

* 2 Exploration for shapes 
Depends on 10 

* 3 Exploration of X 
Depends on 10 

* 4 Exploitation for confinement 
Depends on 9 
** CPU = 64 

* 5 Code cost simulation 

* 6 Code runtime estimation 

* 7 BigRed 2?
*OPTIONAL?*

* 8 Different finish thresholds
Exploit confinement and one other? 
** 90%
** 80%

* 11 Exploitation for shapes and X 

* 12 Waiting time graphs 

* 13 Checkpointing analysis 

* 14 BigRed 2 performance
